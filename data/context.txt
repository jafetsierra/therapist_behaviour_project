Thanks for filling it out. We give this form to everyone once a year regardless of why they come in. It helps us provide better care. Is it okay if I take a look at what you put down?->question
So, let's see. It looks that you put-- You drink alcohol at least four times a week on average-->therapist_input
-and you usually have three to four drinks when you do drink.->therapist_input
Okay. That's at least 12 drinks a week.->therapist_input
Okay. Just so you know, my role, um, when we talk about alcohol use, is just to share information about risk and to help patients who want help. This is different than telling them what I think they should do. I don't do that.->therapist_input
Uh, what else can you tell me about your drinking.->question
Okay. So, can I share with you some information on alcohol use?->question
Okay. So, there has been a lot of research on alcohol use and the guidelines we use in this country says that having seven or more drinks per week can raise the risk of health problems for women.->therapist_input
Seven.->therapist_input
Yeah, you're surprised to hear that?->question
Well things like heart disease, cancer, liver problems, uh, stomach pains, insomnia. Unfortunately, uh, people who drink at a risky level are more likely to be diagnosed with depression and alcohol can make depression worse or harder to treat.->therapist_input
Well, how do you think your drinking relates to the depression you've experienced?->question
Okay. And how do you feel after you drink?->question
So, there are some answers on this form here. Uh, less than monthly you drank more than you intended to.->therapist_input
And sometimes you feel guilty after you drink.->therapist_input
So you're not proud of finishing a bottle?->question
Right. By the way, binge drinking is defined for women as having more than, uh, three drinks and there are about five drinks in a bottle. So, you enjoy drinking wine because it helps make things, uh, a little bit more interesting when you're feeling down but at the same time you don't like drinking when you have more than you want it to and then the depression returns after you drink.->reflection
Where do you wanna go from here? What do you wanna change about your drinking habits?->question
If I gave you a scale from 0 to 10, 0 being not ready at all to cut back on drinking and 10 being very ready, what number would you be at?->question
Okay. Why do you think it's not something less like a six?->question
What would help you cut back to two drinks?->question
Having less wine in the house will help?->reflection
What else besides drinking helps you relax and unwind in the evenings?->question
So, it's not just wine that helps you relax. Um, there's reading a book, watching a movie, and taking a hot bath too.->reflection
Okay. So, it sounds like you have some reasons to cut back on drinking and you have ways to relax besides drinking and it sounds like you're pretty ready to cut back.->therapist_input
Great. I'd be interested to see how well you do on your goal in the next few weeks. Would you be willing to come back and talk to me about it?->question
Great. So, let's see how well you're doing with these new meds.->other
And before you leave, uh, is it okay if we go over this screening form that you filled out today on your alcohol use?->question
Okay. Uh, thanks for filling this out. Uh, looks like you use alcohol two to three days a week?->reflection
Okay. And then when you do drink alcohol, you typically have five or six drinks.->reflection
Okay. Well, the reason why I like to talk to patients when they fill out this form is because sometimes, uh, alcohol use can impact our health. Um, and my role is to be helpful. I can share some information with you about alcohol use, um, but I don't tell anyone what to do. It's always up to the patient to decide what they wanna do about their drinking. Um, so is it okay if we talk a little bit more about your alcohol use?->question
How would you define drinking too much?->question
Mm-hmm. Well, in this country, the guidelines are men can drink up to 14 drinks a week or up to four on one occasion and still be low risk.->therapist_input
So a limit of four a night doesn't feel right to you?->reflection
You're not alone in feeling that way. Uh, binge drinking can feel normal to some people.->reflection
Why is that?->question
Mm-hmm. Well, technically, we define binge drinking as having more than four drinks on one occasion.->therapist_input
Well, uh, we know if someone binge drinks over time, there's kind of two categories of risk. There's the short-term risk where someone who binge drinks is more likely to fall down, hurt themselves through an accident, uh, they're more likely to drive while under the influence. Uh, but over the long term, binge drinking can also, uh, cause things like heart disease, uh, different kinds of cancer, liver problems obviously, and then even mental health issues like depression and anxiety are more likely to happen.->therapist_input
Can I ask you, uh, what do you like about drinking alcohol?->question
And so what about your drinking do you not like or is there anything that worries you about your drinking?->question
So, on one hand, you like how beer tastes, uh, it's part of your social life to some extent, um, but on the other hand, you don't like the idea of it posing risks to your health over the long term?->reflection
So weighing those things, you know, what you like about your drinking, what you don't like about your drinking, uh, where do you wanna go from here? Uh, what would you like to change about your drinking?->question
Well, how about hypothetically if I were to ask you, how would your drinking have to impact your life in order for you to be ready to change your drinking?->question
So if you experienced a negative consequence from your drinking, uh, that would feel meaningful to you?->reflection
Okay. Well, I like to give this handout to patients. Uh, it defines risky drinking, it talks about what the consequences are, uh, and it also lists signs of what an alcohol use disorder is. So thanks again for taking the time to fill this out and being honest with me, uh, to talk about it. I provide better care, uh, when I know about my patient's substance use. When we come back for a three-month follow-up appointment for your ADHD, I'd also like to talk to you and check in about your alcohol use too, if that's okay with you.->therapist_input
Okay, great. See you next time.->therapist_input
Hi, John. Nice to see you again. So, tell me, how are things going?->question
Well, I appreciate you bringing your weight to the forefront. Do you mind if we explore this issue further?->question
All right. Uh, well, it sounds like you've been struggling with your weight recently. And I understand how difficult it is to lose the weight and then have it come back again. So, tell me what you did to lose that initial 5 pounds.->reflection
But you did have some success. Tell me how you felt when you lost the weight.->reflection
Okay. Well, it sounds like you realized that when you lost the weight you feel better and that it's gonna affect your overall health. So, tell me what you think changed that caused you to gain the weight back.->reflection
And how many servings of fruits and vegetables on average per day would you have?->question
John, it's very important that you recognize that some fruits, but especially fruit juice can contain a huge amount of calories. Did you know that a glass of orange juice has almost as many calories as a can of cola?->therapist_input
You're absolutely right, but keep in mind that the food pyramid is to be used as a guideline only. When it comes to nutrition, we have to have a more personalized approach. So I have a hunch, and that is the excess fruit that you were consuming probably caused your weight rebound. What's your impression?->therapist_input
Indeed. Let me ask you something, knowing what you know now, how important is it to you to lose the weight by decreasing the amount of juice that you're currently taking in?->question
Oh, I understand. Let me ask you this, on a scale from 0 to 10, 0 meaning that there's no way you can do it, and 10 meaning that you're 100% confident that you can do it, how confident are you that you'll be able to reduce the amount of juice you're currently taking in.->therapist_input
All right. So, you're not a zero. So, that tells me that you've got some confidence that this is doable, this is something you certainly can do it. Why are you not a zero?->question
So, you realize, again, that if you decrease the amount of juice you're taking in, you're gonna decrease your weight, you're gonna feel better, and you're gonna impact your po- health positively?->reflection
But you're also not a 10, and that tells me that there may be some obstacles to your success. What would it take for you to be a 10 or even an 8 or 9?->question
Okay. Now, if the juice was still there, can you think of anything else you could do?->question
Excellent. John, I get the impression that you want to stay in course with weight reduction. And the best way to do this will be to decrease the amount of juice that you're currently taking in. So if I saw you in two weeks and I asked you how much juice you're t- drinking and how you did it, what would you tell me?->reflection
Excellent. Well, it sounds like you have a plan. Same scale, 0 to 10, how confident are you that you can, uh, make this happen?->question
I agree. All right. Well, you-you know what? I'm not gonna start any medications today. Your levels were a little bit off, but I think we can handle this from a purely lifestyle standpoint. What do you think?->therapist_input
Excellent. I'll see you in two weeks.->therapist_input
Okay, and so what I'm hearing is that you don't feel like your health is concerning you right now, or anything like that?->reflection
Okay.->other
Okay. Have you noticed putting on any weight, or anything like--?->question
Okay. Okay. And how about going to see the doctor? Have you gone to-- for a visit or anything recently?->question
Okay. But you feel that you feel good?->question
Okay. Um, and so what I hear is that you're-- you feel like your wife might be, uh, overreacting to this?->reflection
Sure. Sure. Okay. Um, and so one thing I'd just like to do is maybe give you some information on, um, maybe obesity or diabetes if you're interested or open to that. If you're, you know--?->question
Okay. Good.->other
Hi, Emily.->other
It's been a while.->other
This is something new.->reflection
You got your lip pierced. How long ago did you get that done?->question
Hmm.->other
What made you decide to get-get a lip piercing?->question
Yeah, and it looks nice.->other
Um, I guess, you know, as your dentist, I have- I have a couple of concerns about lip piercings, oral piercings. I wonder what have you heard about how having an oral piercing can affect your-your teeth or your gums?->question
Mm-hmm.->other
You do. you have beautiful teeth as I always tell you-->other
-every time you come in.->other
Um, I mean I have had some patients with oral piercings and they can erode some of the gum right, um, just right there at the front.->therapist_input
Um, so that's one-one thing, and the other is, um, I do see fair amount of chipped teeth-->therapist_input
-just from contact with it. I wonder what are your thoughts about that?->question
Yes, flossing.->reflection
There's nothing yet.->reflection
Yeah. There's certainly been-- There's no problems and you, as you said, only have had it for a short time.->reflection
Um, what would- what would make you decide, "This is something that's not right for me?"->question
I guess that it does.->other
Yeah, it looks nice. So, you want to monitor it and-and-->therapist_input
-really watch-->therapist_input
-the effect? Okay.->therapist_input
Emily, you said it so well it-->other
-the-the piercing might not last forever, but your teeth really are-->reflection
-hopefully forever. So, okay, well thanks for-for talking about it-->other
-with me, and also before I do the exam, you know, I'm always on your case about flossing, so maybe we can take [inaudible 00:02:46]-->other
