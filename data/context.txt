All right. Well, maybe it's something we can work on together. And, you know, I think we should come up with a plan that's gonna work for you so that you can get control here and stop drinking.->therapist_input
Well, you know, uh, Scott, well, tell me a little bit since you brought that up. Yeah, obviously, drink and tell me a little bit about your [unintelligible 00:07:35]->question
How are you feeling today?->question
-your drinking eventually?->reflection
Cool.->other
So, Liz, what's something that you'd like to change or maybe that you're feeling two ways about right now?->question
Not many?->question
You're feeling regretful.->reflection
-when you think about what he-he-- Yeah, he's stereotypical.->reflection
And it sounds like your mom has been an option in the past, but perhaps not so much anymore.->reflection
Emily, why? Why did you get your lip pierced?->question
And the top two are family happiness and religion?->question
Right, they weren't looking out for your best interest at that point.->reflection
Um, how do you think that the drinking fits in with that?->question
Fantastic. Well, um, now we can start looking at if you're interested in how that might look-->therapist_input
Yeah. It should feel like there's something really wrong with you.->other
Oh, fun.->other
Yeah. Yeah->other
So, given what you're-you're attempting to do, when would it be good for you to come back and talk about this?->question
Mm-hmm. So kind of 9:00 to 5:00 sort of job.->reflection
Mm-hmm. So what's the- what's the-- Say, if you get on the course-->other
Yeah. Don't put words in your mouth. I'm sure if that is—->reflection
Okay. So, I'm going to write down then that you've decided to quit.->therapist_input
Especially with your job and-->reflection
Okay. Well, the reason why I like to talk to patients when they fill out this form is because sometimes, uh, alcohol use can impact our health. Um, and my role is to be helpful. I can share some information with you about alcohol use, um, but I don't tell anyone what to do. It's always up to the patient to decide what they wanna do about their drinking. Um, so is it okay if we talk a little bit more about your alcohol use?->question
Chewing gum.->other
Yeah. Yeah. You know, I've been thinking about, um, thinking about you, and thinking about, um, that first meeting we had, and where you are now. So, wh-what do you think some of the changes are that-that you've made in this- in this, sort of, five-five to six weeks that we've been meeting?->question
Okay. Um, so are you here to maybe work on your marriage? Is that an area that you are wanting to-to work on?->question
Okay. Can you tell me a little bit more about how, like, it's-it's not an issue for you?->question
Um, I-I'm reluctant to give a prescription for that because I think it's really up to you. And I think it depends on how things go, as to how much you need to do.->therapist_input
Okay. So, that might be good, is really just to focus more on band. Um, because you know, the other big concern I have for you is if you wanna go to medical school, you're not ever gonna get into medical school if you're drinking like this.->other
And do you agree that that's what you need to do in order to be able to get home?->question
Oh. Oh, okay. So, Um, around that, um, do you ever feel-- You feel bad or-or sick when you're-- Right now, is there something--->question
Right. Six months. That's a long time.->reflection
Hi, are you Katie?->question
Yeah. And you're still with her?->question
Yeah. Yeah. And so you've got Donna around at the moment?->question
Okay. And you know, what's- what's happening for the- for the day, for the week.->reflection
Okay. So we're talking about spending £50 a week-->reflection
-you want to make.->reflection
Your housemate may be willing to give you Narcan if they see you overdosing.->reflection
And now a total stranger will give you a cigarette-->reflection
Yeah. So, when you've had to write things or fill out forms before, how-how's that been for you?->question
So, thank you for coming in today.->other
Does he drive long distances-->question
So I think it should be really supportive of that then.->reflection
How much does it actually cost you a week?->question
Yeah. Yeah. So, if you had- if you had consistent work, it would change your life in a lot of ways.->reflection
Okay. You're sure? Okay. All right. Um, well, that's probably it then. You can, uh, head back to class and-and thanks for coming in.->other
So what is a typical week for you as far as your alcohol use?->question
I don't know how you're feeling right now but I'm just wondering if we can take a-just a quick glance at this-->question
So I'm wondering, you know, most of them butt-butts head on your friendships with those- with those guys.->other
-sounds really, you know, like it's making you feel good about yourself and—->reflection
Mm-hmm, mm-hmm. So I see this is- this is something you've been thinking about for a while. So how far away do you think you are from that change? You know, 'cause obviously it can-can be on the never, never, but how far away are you from it, making some decisions about that?->question
-concern about being safe.->reflection
Mm-hmm. So when you say mostly, it kind of leaves a little bit of room for there to be some trouble.->reflection
What could be a- what could be a first step towards that?->question
Okay, I see. You wanna be a different sort of dad-->reflection
It's my-- yeah it's my pleasure. It's part of my job and it's probably like this so. I'm going to hurry up and get changed for practice.->therapist_input
Okay. What do you know about how that's dangerous?->question
And what would you like me to do if you don't come back?->question
Carrying on.->reflection
Sorry?->other
-and then, um, if things are going great, then fantastic, and if you run into any stumbling blocks, then we can maybe problem-solve together.->other
But just that bad luck?->question
Good. Anybody else in your family that would be really proud of-- that you're taking these steps?->question
You kind of got a reality check today.->reflection
Okay, so you get singled out and that's what, um, means that you end up getting-- having to go to court and get sentenced and end on probation.->reflection
-and it's not one that you're gonna make in a hurry.->reflection
-instead of zero days.->reflection
Okay. And it sounds like you're listening to that black and white line.->reflection
Oh what-- So, what does serious look like? Um--->question
Yep, yep. Could that mean that some of your friends are probably moving around some similar sort of stuff like you, wondering about where they're going and-->question
Okay. What things would make it easier for you to not drink?->question
Don't inject it?->reflection
All right. Yeah. I mean, we got to have a deal here if you're going to be on the team. Okay?->therapist_input
So the-the-the law of, um, felony convictions is-is something that you don't have any control over. I mean, nobody does. So, um, you know, and I'm thinking about how you were talking about getting all the way through the interview and then getting rejected, you know, versus being upfront about it and-and even on the telephone to see whether it's a deal breaker or not, because it must- it sounds like it's so much harder to have that good interview and walk out of there ad know you've done well, and then get turned down.->reflection
What did your doctor tell you to expect in terms of side effects?->question
Okay. And so he's a truck driver and you are an aspiring social worker, and you have a son who you want to give a really great life to, and you feel that you and your boyfriend are in different, going in different directions-->reflection
Mm-hmm. A nice car, a nice house. Mm-hmm, what else? What must be a happy life for Billy?->question
Okay. So about eight cigarettes. So over the course of a day, just under half a pack?->reflection
Okay. So, it sounds like you have some reasons to cut back on drinking and you have ways to relax besides drinking and it sounds like you're pretty ready to cut back.->therapist_input
-you really mentioned that anxiety-->reflection
I understand. So tell me, how often do you drink?->question
So, how long do you think you could go without drinking?->question
Yeah. Takes a lot. Takes a lot. And you're the only one that'll- that can know what it is you're willing to work through that fear for.->therapist_input
Yeah. So, thinking about, like, you know, last time, you-you started to say that, well, you thought it was-- you deserved it and there was some thinking around that, so I'm, sort of, wondering how open you are to-to exploring that from some different angles?->question
You've been managing in the best way you can. You also have some doubts about it too, it sounds like?->reflection
Okay, great. Um, do you drink alcohol, including beer or wine?->question
As to what-->question
Okay. So it's, um, so it's good, because you're not drinking and driving, but you're still really drinking a lot. Um, and yeah. Okay. So, let's-let's talk a little bit about that, how you might be able to make some changes. Because I think you really need to- need to stop drinking like this.->other
Certainly, certainly. I'm glad you're willing to talk to him. So before you leave here today, we'll, uh, stop by the scheduler's desk and make an appointment for you to see me back in four weeks, as well as the appointment with Dr. Kirtley. And that way, before you leave, you're all set. So do you have any other questions for me, Sarah?->question
Do you have any idea why that is?->question
Now, it's a discussion you don't really wanna have.->reflection
So it sounds like if you have alcohol, then smoking is very difficult to avoid and you know what you need to do. You need to go home and as your-your son's doctor, I need to tell you you need to go home and throw out those cigarettes. You need to quit.->therapist_input
And then, um, you walk into these places and they might just be almost storefront-->reflection
You got the tube down-down from the top?->question
You don't want to continue.->reflection
The other three?->question
Okay, great, so you're doing well. What sorts of goals do you have for after college- oh, after high school?->question
