"Now, it's a discussion you don't really wanna have.",reflection,2
"Okay, um, so if so where we are right now if I understand is you're feeling more comfortable about the concern about muscle weakness?",reflection,2
What did you notice during those three days when you weren't smoking?,question,0
"Right. If that's a deal-breaker and you both know it from the very beginning, I'm wondering if then really the interview is really something else. I mean, whether they get the job would truly be based on the interview and not-not your criminal record.",therapist_input,1
"Oh, this is the first time anything like this has come up?",question,0
"Yeah, there's something wrong with the, uh, with this bit.",reflection,2
"Hi, Sarah, it's great to meet you. My name is Delwyn, and I'm a counselor here at the clinic. And I heard from your nurse practitioner that you recently had an annual exam in which the topics of smoking and alcohol use came up. Would you mind filling me in a little bit about that?",question,0
Tell me about that.,question,0
"I also heard that it's very much a part of your life. It's something that you've done for a really long time and almost impossible to think about yourself as a non-smoker. Does that capture, for you, some of the good things or things that are keeping you smoking?",reflection,2
"Well, I-I need to tell you that the-the medicine that she's taking, the chronic inhaler, which is really essential to controlling her asthma does-- is not a steroid like you're thinking. It's-it's much safer, it's very safe, she-- and she needs to take it to get her asthma under control, and I also want to tell you that, uh, your smoking does affect her asthma, even if- even if it's outside, it gets on her clothes, and to be honest, I'd like to see you quit smoking for you anyway. But, uh, if you want to keep her out of the emergency room, she needs to use that chronic inhaler every day, and you need to watch your smoking.",therapist_input,1
Seven.,therapist_input,1
That's great. What do you think you'll study?,question,0
They do.,other,3
"There's a, uh, your record has a conviction?",question,0
"Not really, okay. Well, have you ever heard of something called Tai Chi? Is that a familiar term to you?",question,0
"I think you're wrong. You know, it really worries me. Anyway, um, I wish you would quit. If all you're going to do is cut down, that's better than nothing. You know, I appreciate you talking to me about this, but I'm gonna keep talking to you about it. It's really important.",therapist_input,1
"I have one, um, idea that is jumping into my mind as you're talking. Is it okay if I share that?",question,0
When did you start?,question,0
"Mm-hmm. So, when do you think you're gonna do that?",question,0
"Yeah, okay, so that will be a call you-you've got to make.",other,3
"- but you perhaps feel you've not had enough investigations. And at times, you worry that this could be something quite serious like a-",reflection,2
It does kinda come off as nosy at times I'm sure.,reflection,2

"Sarah, So what do you think Sarah would say?",question,0
"Excellent. John, I get the impression that you want to stay in course with weight reduction. And the best way to do this will be to decrease the amount of juice that you're currently taking in. So if I saw you in two weeks and I asked you how much juice you're t- drinking and how you did it, what would you tell me?",reflection,2
-and that you don't have to sign a contract and you're right. It's hard to tell what the cost is just from looking on the website.,reflection,2
"Well, it's very much up to you, you're the boss of your own life. Where would you like to start?",question,0
"You decided to drink more than you intended because you were disappointed at how the Vikings were playing. And when your roommate couldn't give you a ride home, you decided to drive yourself home. Did I get that right?",therapist_input,1
-now that you're with Donna?,question,0
-things may happen in life.,reflection,2
"Well, the question is, I suppose, that I have for you is, where would you think, for you, would be a good place to start? If you were gonna make any changes, even small changes at the beginning, rather than just thinking, oh, I got to change everything, which it sounds like you're not prepared to, you know, do a whole lifestyle change, and I don't think that's what we're talking about here. Where would you feel most comfortable to start if you were gonna make any changes at all?",question,0
Okay. I respect that. Thanks though for coming in to see me today.,other,3
As long as I don't talk too much?,reflection,2
"Yeah. Well, a big bowl of vegetable soup. You could probably count that as one or maybe even two of your five a day. So it'd be a really good place to start. Anything else you could think about doing?",reflection,2

The number. Just the number.,therapist_input,1
"'Cause, you know, the problem is if they're drinking, they're gonna pressure you into drinking and then you're gonna feel awkward and, you know, you're gonna be stuck and-and not know what to do and really you'd just be better off probably without them. If they're- if they're the kind of people who are gonna keep drinking-",reflection,2
One.,other,3
You've really had a good week.,reflection,2
Mm. What does being a good parent look like? Tell me more about that.,question,0

"Hi, my name is Beth. I'm the nurse that works with the nurse practitioner Mrs. Smith that you just saw. Do you have a moment to talk?",therapist_input,1
"All right, so, I guess just to get started, can you tell me a little bit about yourself?",question,0
"We don't really recommend that. The idea is you would use the nicotine replacement to actually quit, so then you wouldn't be smoking at work, but you also wouldn't be smoking the rest of the time either.",therapist_input,1
Would it be okay if I shared a little more information with you about the flu vaccine and the importance of it?,question,0
"Yeah, caught the bus to-to that-- to the stop outside the office?",reflection,2
"Okay. Um, so gosh, you're-you're actually really drinking quite a lot. Um, you know, your level of drinking puts you in what we call a high-risk group.",therapist_input,1
Smart girl.,reflection,2
Yeah. You're-you're-you're it.,reflection,2
For your family?,question,0

That's a really good decision.,other,3
"Okay. So, what's the longest you've ever gone without a cigarette including being in the hospital?",question,0
"All right. Well, maybe it's something we can work on together. And, you know, I think we should come up with a plan that's gonna work for you so that you can get control here and stop drinking.",therapist_input,1
"Not like you're working for the government or for a bank or, you know, the FBI where- those are not things you're applying for. They're jobs where you would wonder why a-a non-violent felony would even--",reflection,2
"Uh-huh. So, you're wanting to get home to your dog, your garden, back to your life, your independence?",reflection,2
"And that's helping keep you in check, as you said?",reflection,2
"Okay, so actually having someone listen to you and hear about what you're saying is important to you?",reflection,2
Hi Mr. Johnson?,question,0
And-and it's hard to replace it with something.,therapist_input,1
"So tell me a little bit about what you're doing, what is- what is the concern that they are raising.",therapist_input,1
Why not a one or a two?,question,0
"So, what happened. So first of all, tell me what you did, exactly.",other,3
Okay. Okay.,other,3
A seven. Why do you think you picked that instead of a lower number like five?,therapist_input,1
"That's interesting isn't it? You-- 'cause you kind of mentioned it there, like, you know, on one side of the coin, um, it helps calm the nerves to get yourself get out there and-",reflection,2
"-and, again, I'll get some out and I'll show you what they look like. This course of medication lasts for 10 to 12 weeks. And we strongly recommend that people stay on the whole course of medication and that that gives you the best chance of success. Stopping smoking is not easy but it's possible and with the type of support that we offer here in the pharmacy, you absolutely make your chance of success four times greater than trying on your own, so, that's why it's really good that you've come to see me. Now, what you said is you really want to do it and that next week sounds like a good day for you to start because the party is over and done with.",therapist_input,1
Not going to bed on time.,reflection,2
"Well, there's a lot of things you can do yourself that will improve the situation as well. So what we can do today is wee up some of those things, smoking, diet, exercise, weight, loss, all those kinds of things. So we're just gonna start and see how you feel as we go.",therapist_input,1
"Yeah. It sounds so crazy, doesn't it? Like the- it- when it feels like inside, what you're- what I'm hearing from you is that it feels like inside like moving is unsafe.",reflection,2
How were you successful when you quit before?,question,0
And what would you like me to do if you don't come back?,question,0
"Yeah? So, what-what would interest you about going down that same, sort of, path?",question,0
Thank you.,other,3
So we're looking good.,reflection,2
And you're not experiencing where these two things are separate? They just seem to be together more often than not?,question,0
"Okay. So, that might be good, is really just to focus more on band. Um, because you know, the other big concern I have for you is if you wanna go to medical school, you're not ever gonna get into medical school if you're drinking like this.",other,3
It feels like it was like two days was a year?,question,0
But they go together so well. And sugar in the coffee?,question,0

All right. Okay. Can you tell me a bit more about your tummy problems?,question,0
Would you be open to kind of looking at the low-risk drinking alcohol guidelines?,question,0
"-amongst the people you typically drink with. But these limits are-- they're actually recommended for all adults. And studies have shown that when you drink more than this, it creates a bunch of problems like we talked about. So, you know, why do you think you drink the amount you drink?",therapist_input,1
"So you've made a decision in your life not to smoke cigarettes, that's something you didn't want to do. It sounds like you're kinda concerned about the health effects of cigarettes. But you have been smoking the little cigarillos at least one or two every time you go out.",reflection,2
"That's a great word for it there. Yeah. So, um-",reflection,2
"Can I ask you, uh, what do you like about drinking alcohol?",question,0
How's that going?,question,0
"So that was helpful for you that it's a, um, I can't remember. I know what you're trying to get a little ball.",reflection,2

"Okay, okay. Now, have you thought about when you wanted to quit by?",question,0
"All right, and he's right. This medication will help lower your cholesterol, and it will help lower your risk of having a heart attack or a stroke. How did the doctor tell you to take this medicine?",therapist_input,1
"There might be something [unintelligible 00:06:43] because you're such a social guy. And so to be able to be exercising and be talking and enjoying yourself- you like the music too, right?",reflection,2
She doesn't want to get you in trouble and I heard you say earlier on that you've been keeping out of trouble.,reflection,2
"So 'cause-'cause I asked the question before, is what might be the hardest thing, and you'd identified that your friends, you know, could be one of the habits.",question,0
You kind of got a reality check today.,reflection,2
"-How could it be the right one? Ending your life hurting yourself when it's just you and your mom. And you just said, she's a single parent. She doesn't have a husband, you don't have a dad. It's just the two of you. So how could it be the right choice? But I understand your pain and I know where you're coming from. And I know that the release that you feel physically is something that helps you in the moment. Are there other things that we can help you find to start replacing, um, that behavior?",question,0
That must be really scary.,reflection,2
"So, you were thinking because your-your friends weren't pressuring you to stop drinking, that-that it must be okay.",reflection,2
Might get you into trouble [unintelligible 00:05:06],reflection,2
You wanna stop getting into trouble.,reflection,2
"Yeah. That's all right, yeah. That's good. It sounds like you know yourself pretty well.",reflection,2
Absolutely. Yeah.,other,3

Yeah there's possible.,other,3
-concern about being safe.,reflection,2
Haven't quite that-,other,3
"-um, try to tackle, um, your childcare issue, um, with some assistance. Is there anything else you'd like to do, um, for example, would you be interested in talking with me again, um, just as things progress?",question,0
Okay. So what about maybe sharing a little bit about your alcohol intake and maybe a little bit about what your- what your life's like a little bit for me today?,question,0
"Uh, that it's okay with you, and you-you know that it's gonna change because that's been your, uh, experience.",reflection,2
A gastroscopy.,other,3
So how are you feel in your head-,question,0
"Um, and I know some clients have expressed just really valuing their freedom. They didn't realize how much they really valued that until it was gone.",other,3
"Well, what can be more important to you than the health of your child?",other,3
Yeah. So that's-that's some work that we can continue to work with. Yeah? Yeah?,other,3
-every day.,reflection,2
What kind of plan could you put in place to make sure you meet these goals?,question,0
So what stopped you over the last-- How long have you been out now?,question,0
"Yeah. Oh, okay. So-so, what about that? The-- Is there other incidences that you could think of that seems, uh, um, alcohol was there, and then your luck just sorta took a-a turn, or it was just those two times?",question,0
I get the feeling that your relationship is really important to you. That you would do anything.,reflection,2
Okay. And do you notice a big difference or can you tell me about the difference in your enjoyment level at say a party versus a night you're playing board games?,question,0
"Yeah, it does- it does sound as though over the last few years your life has really changed-",reflection,2
"Okay. So, um, but you gave it a good try and it was just not a good fit for you like you-you really listened to what your body told you like nightmares, nausea, I mean those are really bad things.",reflection,2
"So, what's been different since the last time we talked a week ago?",question,0
"And so sometimes he's gone away from home for, what like, days, weeks?",question,0
"What you've been thinking about, um, over the last little while about getting your life back on track. 'Cause I noticed you've—",question,0
"But on the other hand, it does sound like there are things that you- that you value that you don't want the drinking to interfere with.",reflection,2
Mm-hmm. Okay. Okay. So you think it began about four years ago after this holiday?,reflection,2
Sure.,other,3
That's great. That's really exciting to think about that-,other,3
"Yeah, like sort of-",other,3
Good.,other,3
And you also mentioned you'll perhaps go and- back and see the doctor and just give him a bit of an update as to-,reflection,2
Which build people up and have masculinizing effects.,therapist_input,1
Hmm-hmm.,other,3
Two max. How many drinks would you say you'd have over the course of a week?,question,0

"So, you might have to literally like pack his bags and help them get to those places, um.",reflection,2
"Mm-hmm. It's, uh, I mean the lesser of two evils is that what we're getting at-",therapist_input,1

Right. Six months. That's a long time.,reflection,2
"I really need you to quit smoking. Both for your health and for Aiden. Did you know s-smoking around your child is associated not only with ear infections, it could get to the point where you have to put tubes in his ears pretty shortly here. Also, things like vitamin C deficiency, cavities, like dental cavities, behavior problems, um, asthma, other upper respiratory infections. It's really putting him at a lot of risk. In addition to that, kids of smokers end up smoking themselves. Do you want him to grow up to be a smoker?",therapist_input,1
What's that been like for you in the past?,question,0
[chuckles] Have you ever tried not drinking or stopping drinking?,question,0
"All right. Yeah. I mean, we got to have a deal here if you're going to be on the team. Okay?",therapist_input,1
"Yeah. Yeah. So, if you had- if you had consistent work, it would change your life in a lot of ways.",reflection,2
And you're not allowed to vote.,therapist_input,1
Okay. What do you know about how that's dangerous?,question,0
"Right. Right, right. So the appointments and time.",reflection,2
Mm-hmm. So and what would you-- What would- What would help you get to building up to it? Spending more time there.,question,0
"There's some feelings when you, kind of, think about that?",question,0
And do you mind if we talk about a screening form that you filled out earlier today on drug use?,question,0
Yeah. It doesn't fit.,reflection,2
Yeah. So--,other,3
"Hello, Rick. Welcome.",other,3
"Okay. Um, any questions or anything-",question,0
"Well, let's talk about then how you ended up cutting yourself.",other,3
"Oh, okay. So, I guests maybe five or six.",reflection,2
And there's some things that you might be able to do that would make it easier to not use methamphetamine including talking to your sister and getting some support.,reflection,2
"-that-that, um, that has to happen. Would you like some suggestions about that?",question,0
Mm. What do you think?,question,0
Mr. Johnson?,question,0
"Okay. And how about the use of other drugs like cocaine, heroin, marijuana?",question,0
"Oh, good. Oh, good. And-and so, where do you usually, um, have your drinks? Is it at home or, uh, out-out for, uh- after work, social drinking?",question,0
Nobody there too.,reflection,2
"Discouraged, yeah.",reflection,2
And then there's this other part of you that's- was thinking maybe it's not okay.,reflection,2
"Right now, though, it feels almost too difficult to even manage or even to try?",reflection,2
"100 is like, ""I'm totally interested and-and getting it nailed and sorted and, you know, getting on the straight and narrow."" Where would you be on that scale?",question,0
Very dull.,reflection,2
"So, it's become harder to be a smoker. You light up a cigarette-cigarette and people make assumptions about you.",reflection,2
"Yeah? So, what do you think, between now and next week, you can do around the forms?",question,0
"-potential enemies, friends, who knows which ones.",reflection,2
"I get it. I get it. And so, if you could fit it in, you would like things to be different, but that's not so easy.",other,3
You don't want to continue.,reflection,2
"You wanna know that it's the latest and the greatest kind of thing. Um, this is information that, uh, that I have been sharing with you earlier, this is the latest information evidence-based, um, on the latest research since 2011 and, um, a lot of research has gone into what is-what is okay for a mom to consume, like, alcohol. There's the-the evidence that we have, um, but in the end, you choose what's best for you and what's best for your baby. What are your- what are your thoughts on that?",therapist_input,1
How did you know you messed up?,question,0
"-'cause you owed your mom and dad some money, and they weren't bailing you out anymore, and you had to go out and find some money, I think?",question,0
"Hello, nice to meet you again. And, uh, and what seems to be the-the problem or what-what prompted you to come along?",question,0
"Well, some patients who inject heroin are interested in a medication called Suboxone. It reduces cravings, withdrawal symptoms without making you high. Some patients want information on how to inject drugs more safely or where to get new syringes. Other patients want to carry Naloxone which is a drug that can prevent one from overdosing.",therapist_input,1
-you really mentioned that anxiety-,reflection,2
You wouldn't boss them around?,reflection,2
You don't wanna let your baby down.,reflection,2
"Sure. Well, it's hard to me to convince you-",therapist_input,1
-and really thinking about what's got you into trouble and hence something about what gets you into trouble.,reflection,2
"All right. Well, this medication is usually well tolerated, which means that it doesn't have very many side effects, but you might experience some muscle aches or pains. If they seem really severe to you, then you should call Dr. Ferris and talk to him about that. Also, this medication can interact with over-the-counter medicines or even other medications. So before you start something new, you should check with either Dr. Ferris or myself. And lastly, this medication can interact with grapefruit juice. So while you're taking this medicine, I would avoid grapefruit juice.",therapist_input,1
"Yeah. No, but how smart on your part to know that if you would- if you would had to play with her, something bad would've happened.",reflection,2
"Excellent. Well, it sounds like you have a plan. Same scale, 0 to 10, how confident are you that you can, uh, make this happen?",question,0
"Katie, it sounds like smoking pot is helping you somewhat in helping you relax and it's also causing you a lot of stress because you're trying to use it to fit in and that's not helping, you're worried about getting caught, you're worried about family disapproval. Having said all that, what do you think you wanna do about your pot use?",reflection,2
"Just so I know we're on the same page, can you repeat back to me how you'll take this medicine?",question,0
"Okay, and so I guess, you know, what would you like to do given the circumstances?",question,0
"Yeah, you're surprised to hear that?",question,0
"You know. And so-- yeah, and that- and that does concern people. But I do want to reassure you that this is medication that only goes to her lungs, and won't get in her body and they're not the same kind of drugs as the ones you're worried about.",therapist_input,1
Can you describe why you're hesitant?,question,0
The very first time that you can remember?,question,0
"So, am I- am I right in thinking you perhaps decide on a day-to-day basis-",reflection,2
"Sure, of course, Hailey a-and again I really appreciate your openness and honesty about letting me know what's going on with, you know, the stress levels and coping and drinking. I just had a thought that there's also a good mom's group, we run out of our center. So if you'd like a referral to that or some information, I'd be happy to give you and while you think about it, if you want to, um, talk about this further with one of my colleagues, I'd be happy to make you an appointment.",therapist_input,1
"Okay. And if you need more information, we can get that for you.",therapist_input,1
A bit broad kind of like you've gotta change everything.,reflection,2
"Got it. I-I can understand that. [chuckles] Uh, any other things that you can think of?",question,0
You-you would be the corporate company.,reflection,2
"So, what brings you here, Bob? What's, what can I do to help?",question,0
"-and get it out of the way. Maybe I know in the past it's been helpful for some other clients to sit down and take a calendar and just mark out, okay, I'm gonna do five hours this day, I'm gonna do three hours this day, two hours of this day. Does that sound like something that might be helpful for you?",therapist_input,1
"So, if-if-if we could maybe find a medication that didn't give you as bad side effects, perhaps you might not have to drink as much or at all or smoke a little weed to take the edge off. I mean, who knows? [unintelligible 00:09:55]",reflection,2
"Okay, so you don't wanna end up kind of being in prison again 'cause you've done some time inside. Yeah, and you don't wanna end up going back to prison, yeah. So-so that's one thing about wanting to make a difference and the way things are at the moment, yeah.",reflection,2
Mm. Came out of the blue for you?,reflection,2
Okay. So how do you feel about being here today?,question,0
But you've done your duty. Duty is done.,reflection,2
"-or getting in fights."" You know, one thing you could bring up is, ""I've heard a lot of stories about kids who you know, are at parties and they're drunk and acting stupid, and then people post stuff on Instagram.""",therapist_input,1
-and knowing how it's gonna turn out.,reflection,2
Yeah. Is there somebody that you could call?,question,0
I'd love to hear from you. When was the time in the past that you were feeling anxious about something and you actually did it and it turned out well?,question,0
"-to work on meeting some people, so-",other,3
I think that would be a good idea. I think we've only just begun to talk about it-,therapist_input,1
"Okay, well, that's a good start, but cutting back isn't going to do it. If you actually quit the smoking, you can reverse all the damage you've done in your mouth, and you can stop yourself from- from being at risk for these other diseases. But as long as you're continuing to use these cigars you're really putting yourself in a lot of danger.",therapist_input,1
"Okay. Uh, how much do your friends drink?",question,0
They're important.,reflection,2
Oh good. You got family out here?,question,0
That's right.,other,3
Thanks.,other,3
It's quite interesting. Was that a fashion shoot or something?,question,0
"Okay. So sort of in the-the too much drinking or-or at times, can you tell me some of the less good things or not so good things about alcohol?",question,0
"I really applaud you for being open-minded enough to realize that where you are now is not necessarily where you are, that you don't have to always have it be the same.",other,3
"Mm-hmm. Yeah, so what in particular? Like, if you could have whatever you wanted, in terms of that sort of work, what would you do?",question,0
"When you think five years ahead, which-which position do you wanna be in? Which-which feels best? Party girl still, you know, with those four credit cards maxed out major, or would you wanna be actually, you know, thinking about having traveled and, you know, maybe, starting a family, those other things? Which-which direction feels best for you at this point?",question,0
"Yeah, I can understand that. Um, what are some of your natural skills?",question,0
Okay. Anything else?,question,0
That's pretty cool that you did that.,reflection,2
Any thoughts on considering quitting smoking at this time?,question,0
"Okay. So, what sort of training did you-- did these people, that you've been talking about, what did they do?",question,0
"Oh wow, it was-",other,3
Like a new beginning.,reflection,2
"Yeah. Well, maybe you can start leading as a non-drinker then.",therapist_input,1
"Okay, so we talked about sort of where things you-w-- Where you might be in five years and which path you wanna take, yep, yep? And you seemed very clear about it.",other,3
-and-and I think you mentioned done-done a little bit towards that.,reflection,2
"Okay. Well, the-the side effect is something that's very, very rare, it's not really something you need to worry about, and the risk of stroke or heart attack is much worse.",therapist_input,1
"Okay, what made you choose seven or eight as opposed to a-a five?",question,0
What are you drinking? What's the quantity that you're drinking.,question,0
"So, live, um, having that as a priority, um, do you feel as though, like you said before you'll live, but you know that you're able to look at, okay, these are my values, you know, and you're able to acknowledge [unintelligible 00:07:30] values.",reflection,2
You can't se it?,question,0
"Yeah-yeah, how important would it- would it be? Zero being not so important and 10 being pretty important that you--",question,0
"Nice to meet you, too. Thanks for coming in today.",other,3
Anything else to make things easier for you?,question,0
"Well, uh, wait a second, Sal, what do you mean you-you- ha- If you-- As in-- You know to be informed about-- I'm just really taken aback by that because I understand from your chart that you have a young baby-",reflection,2
-the expectation of life on the inside something?,question,0
"So part of that whole keeping fit and exercise stuff is actually the social side of it, isn't it?",reflection,2
"Well, it was nice talking to you.",other,3
"Okay. So, these automatic cigarettes, when you're socializing and you're-- you have time on your hands, really, are the problems that you're facing-",reflection,2
"Okay, so we [unintelligible 00:09:47] something that interests you.",reflection,2
"Okay. So a patch is something you've already seen, and-",reflection,2
You were surprised?,question,0
-guiding your baby and-,reflection,2
Not at all.,therapist_input,1
Okay. And how about unprotected sex? It sounds like you don't want to experience that again.,reflection,2
"So let me tell you what I normally do in this, um, this interview, and we-we'll talk for up to maybe 20 minutes or so. Normally what I do is just give some feedback from all of those questionnaires that you answered last week-",therapist_input,1
"Okay, you're over that one, okay. So, let's start to think about what might be the first step.",therapist_input,1
"Okay, well how important would it be for you to-to, uh, do whatever you can to reduce your risks of stroke or heart attack down the line?",question,0
Just-,other,3
Yeah. You're-you're tired. You're stressed. You feel so sad to the point that you're hurting yourself physically so that you can feel something other than what you're feeling right now.,reflection,2
"Okay. So I'm hearing you say that the situation with your mom's not ideal. You actually miss class sometime and had to lose some work shifts as well, and that's problematic.",reflection,2
Okay. So is there anything else that you like about it?,question,0
"So let me make sure that I understand all of the good things about smoking, the things that you like about it, and let me know if I've missed anything or left anything out.",reflection,2
"So it's really, I suppose, up to how things go for you, and you get that feedback. And if that's going in the right direction, you carry on doing and do some more of that.",reflection,2
"Um, and so thanks for- thanks for taking a couple of minutes and talking about smoking.",therapist_input,1
But we're also talking about this idea that it doesn't fit with what your goals are or what your hopes are?,reflection,2
So you're following through on meeting with me today and you mentioned he has some concerns. Can you tell me a little bit about that?,question,0
"Have you ever experienced a-a blackout, like when you've been drinking and you wake up and you don't remember what happened?",question,0
"So weighing what you like and don't like about your use, where do you want to go from here? What do you want to do differently?",question,0
"Yeah, okay.",other,3
"-'cause this is your life and this is your story, and you-you've got to walk your life and I can't walk your life for you. I only walk my. And so, but I can walk with you on this life to try and think about-- 'Cause I-I-- You know, I-I've no interest in actually you falling over and going back into-into a lifestyle a crime 'cause I know where it'll take you. And I'm hearing that with your relationship, where it's going to take your relationship too, [unintelligible 00:16:39] got the bottom line drawn pretty clearly.",reflection,2
"Yeah. So-so you've got this new group of friends and-and, um, you-you actually kind of like where you're at with things right now. And your mom was going through your stuff and found your stash, and it's just turned into a, you know, all of this.",reflection,2
"Right. Okay. Well, I think, Barbara, having-having heard your story, and heard about the symptoms, I'm not sure that actually sending you for more tests at this point would be the most useful thing that we could do for you. And the reason for that is because you've-you've had some of the main investigations in the last couple of years, and-and they've not shown anything. And your symptoms haven't really changed that much. So it's very unlikely that if we were to send you for more tests now that-that they'd show anything different than what we already know. So a bit-- I think it would be a waste of time for you to go for more tests.",other,3
"Mm-hmm. So on one hand, using heroin feels like an escape from things you don't want to think about. On the other hand, it puts you at risk for an overdose in infections.",reflection,2
"So I guess, tell me a bit more about what happens then. So let's focus on maybe an invitation to do a job with, uh, you know, it's going to involve, uh, photography with- with a group of people and you're going to have to have social interaction. What kind of thoughts go through your head?",question,0
"So, reading and writing is not a strong point for you.",reflection,2
Thanks for coming in for participating today. Your sanction will involve being placed on university disciplinary probation and attending an alcohol education seminar that will cost $150.,therapist_input,1
"Six months is a- is a long time. There was, um-- Try to think back, were there- were there other people? Was it- was it just you?",question,0
"Oh, hello Scott.",other,3
"Okay? So a stroke or heart attack is much worse, so make sure you go ahead and pick up your medicine as you're on your way out and, uh, one-one every day to get your cholesterol down.",therapist_input,1
They managed with it.,reflection,2
Sure we can make those arrangements with the rehab center. They have a van-,therapist_input,1
"Yeah, we-- You know, we have about 15 to 20 minutes to talk today, total. Um-um, which certainly it's just the first of-of some sessions that we'll have together over the next six months. It'd be a natural question you'd wanna know how much time this will take, of course. Um, what else would you like me to know about you and your perspective that you think will help me work with you over this time?",therapist_input,1
"Mm, so when I was first talking to you, I thought that you'd have a very, um, really not much interest in not stoping using Methamphetamine but it sounds like you have a number of reasons why you really would like to stop using Methamphetamine. And that is, um, that it might be cut with something else, um, you could get another ST- STD including HIV.",reflection,2
"So, mainly, just kinda hanging out with friends.",reflection,2
Okay. Would it be okay with you if I kind of explained again kind of what this program is about?,question,0
"Okay. So you trusted him on that, and you tried it out and you found that it helped you in certain ways. What are some of the things that you said it's-- takes some of the pain away, it's not just-- you know.",reflection,2
"I mean I'm willing to see her too, you know.",therapist_input,1
You're still feeling the effects of-,reflection,2
"-um, healing-",other,3
"Mm-hmm. Okay, so it sounds like a sort of a vicious cycle and-and maybe the lacking physical activity has made you feel less confident in yourself. I wonder if that's also a piece of this puzzle since you mentioned that's been a big difference from what was happening in the past.",reflection,2
"Okay, alright. Cause it’s tough, it's really, it is. I mean I’ve, um, I’m sure you’ve been told before by whomever, uh, diagnosed your foot injury, but if not, let me know if it gets so tough on your body [unintelligible 00:02:10] let me know. So--",other,3
"So, on the one hand I'm hearing smoking and drinking at night as a way to chill out but at the same time the next day, you're not feeling so great.",reflection,2
-with your mates?,reflection,2
"Mm-hmm. So what sort of mischief are we talking about here, Billy?",question,0
"Uh, and it would certainly help her. Um, but what I'd like you to do is to, kind of, keep an eye on what happens when she uses the chronic inhaler. And if she's still flaring up when you're around her, if there are any, if there is smoke on your clothes because it-it can flare her up.",therapist_input,1
"Zero being, ""Argh, not interested at all,"" 100 being totally into it.",therapist_input,1
"Rick, I get a sense that you're kind of padding this walk a little bit on your own at the moment. Would that be true?",reflection,2
"Oh, and yet and at the same time you know your body well enough, and you-you’re willing to pay attention to your doctor’s advice about the running, right now, for you, not the best thing. Um, so, riding a stationary bike. Um, what else do you like to do that's cardiovascular?",question,0
"-before we go, I'd like to just-just give you a lot of- some information that might help-help you.",therapist_input,1
"Yeah. So you and I are going to be doing a little bit of work together then. And, um, and sometimes it-it can get quite tough. And I'm just wondering before we go any further, when the going gets tough, a lot of guys bail out. I'm just wondering are you one of those guys?",question,0
"Mm. Okay, so your boyfriend?",question,0
Okay. And how do you feel after you drink?,question,0
Mm-hmm. That's something- that's something that's come up before with-with-- when we've been talking about that idea about not liking being bossed around.,reflection,2
-and you got--,question,0
"Okay. Okay. And have there been any times over the last four years that you've noticed any significant changes in your symptoms? For example, have there been any times when things have been better for you?",question,0
"Okay, great. Let's quantify that a little bit. So how many cigarettes would that be?",therapist_input,1
Did they not get along with your girlfriend?,question,0
"Mm-hmm. So, what would that look like for you?",question,0
And then the respect is really sort of all-encompassing.,reflection,2
"So I get the impression that there are some things that you're concerned about, but that overall, coming in here wasn't necessarily the first thing that was on your mind when you came to the hospital with your daughter. Um, so can you tell me, what was it that made it possible for you to even come in? What-what were some of the things you were thinking about?",reflection,2
Almost overwhelming it sounds like.,reflection,2
Okay. And how long has this been going on?,question,0
"Yeah, yeah, and then the blood pressure thing. Does that sound about right?",question,0
"So, tell me a little bit more about your drinking. Tell me a little bit about how much you're drinking, and, um, the pattern, and what raised concern.",question,0
And it sounds like right now you're at a place of acceptance about that also.,reflection,2
What kind of things do you forget?,question,0
"-bit of a shake that I needed, you know, just sort of remind me. I might feel okay. I might-- From my perspective, your perspective, you're thinking, ""Well, what's the problem? Everything's fine.""",reflection,2
It sounds like you're very committed to that.,reflection,2
Okay. Why do you think it's not something less like a six?,question,0
Yet you're sitting here with me today-,reflection,2
-to stop drinking.,other,3
So what will it take for you to start thinking about some of her hopes and sharing some of her hopes?,question,0
"-going back to polytech is-- would-would require a really big change in the way which you're currently living, and you're not quite sure if you can do that.",reflection,2
I love it. Union break.,other,3
"Well, let's get back to your blood pressure then and see what we need to do about that.",other,3
Yeah. It counts.,reflection,2
"So, um, it also, um-- Anyway, it's-it's when people are just saying, ""Um, you know, this is why I don't wanna change. You know, I'm happy the way that I am. You know, it's, you know, um, God made it that marijuana stuff,"" you know, things like that. So-",therapist_input,1
So one thing that you noticed is diet and the eating patterns and-,reflection,2
"I'm good. Um, wow, what's changed? What do we have here?",question,0
"Okay, and allow you to afford everything you need to afford.",reflection,2
"Yeah, good. That sounds good. Mike, has there even been, if any, um, a time in your life when you've thought about, um, not drinking at all?",question,0
"I'm sorry, I'm not a football fan but it's Super Bowl coming up, right?",question,0
"Hmm. So, what- can you let me know or-or what do you know about your asthma and the things that affected or might make it worse?",question,0
"Not huge changes, but some little things you could do.",reflection,2
It's what I'm hearing you saying bring-- be a little bit more in control of what's-what's going on for me.,reflection,2
"Sure. I wonder if now that your workplace is going smoke-free, if there will be some people at work who planning to quit.",question,0
Yeah. So you're wanting to feel stronger so that you can open jars and other things and- and also just have a better sense of confidence.,reflection,2
"Yeah. Well, it's possible you strained your ankle as a result of the alcohol. You know, it can actually affect your balance and stability. So, really, you know, for where you are right now, you're drinking a good amount more than what's recommended. And, you know, I want you to be healthy. And I don't want to see you coming back in here for something else. So I'm really gonna recommend that you try to cut down to that amount. So, do you think you could do that, cut down to no more than three drinks on a given day?",therapist_input,1
"Okay. Well, thank you, Tanya.",other,3
"Sal, what, uh, do you understand that what happened 6 years ago or 10 years ago, your asthma is progressively getting worse. You know very well that the puffers, the strength of the medication is getting higher and higher, and there's only so much that can be done with medication alone. You know this.",therapist_input,1
You must like that statue.,reflection,2
"Well, it's only been a month.",therapist_input,1
"So, do you think sometimes you weren't even aware",question,0
"-over the last year and maybe also the effect on-on um, your job and being able-- maybe you're not auditioning as well as you might.",reflection,2
"So that's a hormone or a chemical, it allows you to utilize sugar in your body.",therapist_input,1
That surprised you?,question,0
Oh.,other,3
You'll start with that?,reflection,2
That's great.,other,3
"Yeah, def-definitely would not. I mean, probably you saw the name corticosteroid and thought, ""uh-oh.""",therapist_input,1
Why did you say eight or nine rather than six or seven?,question,0
Sure. I'm-I'm happy to do that.,other,3
"Okay. Well, I like to give this handout to patients. Uh, it defines risky drinking, it talks about what the consequences are, uh, and it also lists signs of what an alcohol use disorder is. So thanks again for taking the time to fill this out and being honest with me, uh, to talk about it. I provide better care, uh, when I know about my patient's substance use. When we come back for a three-month follow-up appointment for your ADHD, I'd also like to talk to you and check in about your alcohol use too, if that's okay with you.",therapist_input,1
Making some of these changes. Yeah.,reflection,2
Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm.,other,3
Are you surprised what that might be true?,question,0
"So you're watching movies with her, you're hanging out?",reflection,2
"Okay. When students and I talk about their substance use, the first thing I always say, I don't like to tell anyone what to do. That's not my job. Instead, I like to see if there's anything they would like to do, if anything, about their use. So what can you tell me about your marijuana use?",question,0
"Well, that's good. That's probably benefited you already. And the other thing you might not be aware of is that salt intake is linked to loss of calcium from our bones, which makes the bones more fragile. So reducing your salt intake will really help with that too.",therapist_input,1
"All right, uh, well they have your medication ready, and, uh, if you have any questions let us know.",therapist_input,1
Discouraged.,reflection,2
Can you tell me a little bit about that?,question,0
"So, it sounds like you'd be open to reducing as a way to still enjoy the wine but perhaps alleviate the way you feel in the morning, some of the hangover effects that sounds like you're experiencing.",reflection,2
And how does that feel for you now?,question,0
"Okay. So then, like I said, um, I'll try and see if we can meet up maybe in a few weeks and see how it's going-",reflection,2
"Very good. So it looks like, um, you're using a good method of birth control, you're just not able to use it effectively. And you've linked it back here to the drinking. So would you like to develop a plan around your alcohol use at this-- today?",question,0
"So, if you could somehow tackle some of these stressful issues, um, that could make a difference, and, what-what would that be, for example?",question,0
"Hmm. So, based on what your mom told you, you were expecting Lilly at this point to be sleeping through the night?",reflection,2
"You also mentioned that smoking is a way to manage your weight, and concern that if you were-were going to quit smoking, what that would do in terms of, um, gaining weight, and that smoking after meals is pleasurable, that it's something that would be really hard to give up.",reflection,2
Okay. So if you are feeling tempted to stay up later-,reflection,2
How would you know if it was a problem?,question,0
"So I'm wondering if, um, uh, if-if you wanted to, we could get together again and continue to talk 'cause you-you've got some good ideas already. And I'm very open that if you wanted to bring any of your good friends in, that that would also be totally cool too.",therapist_input,1
That's pretty shocking to be told that you have to get rid of your dog.,reflection,2
You kinda juggle those two things and kinda--,reflection,2
"Okay. Well, that makes a lot of sense that people-- it goes both ways.",reflection,2
-oral diseases.,therapist_input,1
"Okay. Um, so what would it look like if you had a plan where both your neighbor and your mom were helping you out?",question,0
So I know we've determined that you sprained your ankle yesterday and I'm wondering if you can tell me a little bit about how that happened?,question,0
"Yeah, and-and in some ways getting caught might be a good thing. I know it might sound a re-really sort of strange thing to say, but I wonder if like getting caught might have been a good thing. Because you would have read the papers about other people's of-- you know. They're the hands that would turn on stuff and end up with gambling problems and big money. So I want- I want to hear much that it might have been a good thing that you got caught at this stage, and you got a chance to do some talking about it and working around some strategies to get it under control so it doesn't control you. What's your hunch about that?",therapist_input,1
"-having people who are good friends, too, is important. And then, what about belonging? You mentioned that one too.",question,0
- used to get pleasure out of. Is that right?,reflection,2
"John, it's very important that you recognize that some fruits, but especially fruit juice can contain a huge amount of calories. Did you know that a glass of orange juice has almost as many calories as a can of cola?",therapist_input,1
"What thoughts do you have about that? What have you heard that others have done, or what are- what are- what thoughts do you have?",question,0
"So on that particular day, what were the thoughts that you had in your head when you were in that situation?",question,0
Is there anything that I can support you with before we wrap up as far as giving up alcohol today?,question,0
This is something new.,reflection,2
"Yeah, so then it's, um, right now, uh, tell me a little bit about, um, right now at this point in your life why it's so important to quit.",question,0
What did your doctor tell you to expect in terms of side effects?,question,0
"Okay. What are some of the pros and cons about moving in with whāna, moving in with your auntie and uncle?",question,0
"Mm-hmm, and-",other,3
"Well, given that you've sort of noticed all these changes where it's affecting your friendships, it's affecting your studying, it's affecting your relationship with your mom. Where do you think you should kind of go from here?",question,0
"So Sandra, what's good about smoking? What do you like about it?",question,0
"Whi-which? If you don't mind me asking, which friends were those? I don't mean to get too personal, but, the friends that normally drank with you or just your-",question,0
Okay. What kind of dog do you have?,question,0
-kind of explore this a little bit further and maybe some of those advantages of reducing to the safe limits. Is that something that we could do?,question,0
And you also checked that sometimes you forget things when you drink.,question,0
So that I can pursue that plan.,reflection,2
"Yeah. You seem a little surprised, I'm-I'm [crosstalk] wondering about, surprising face.",reflection,2
"Oh, neat.",other,3
"Uh, he, yeah, uh, he- they have a lot of, uh, they have a lot of really good stuff on there about this because they're trying to change the laws about that because-",therapist_input,1
"Not being, you know, whatever you did for others. That being, um, as far as, like you said within yourself, that you won't be able to find, um, problems with helping other people. And, uh, that's when service which is your number three or number four, which has been wisdom. You learning different, you know, cultures and having that broad range of-of just opening your eyes and seeing the world in a whole another scope.And then five which being pleasure, which is also okay, I do see the whole world and I know that within myself that I'm able to, you know, accept that I will have things coming out of me as far as, you know, not being, you know, uh, it's like, okay, things might happen. You're gonna get bummed one day but finding joy and pieces [unintelligible 00:10:21]",reflection,2
"Okay. So, it's almost as if you feel a bit torn because you wanna be with Donna, but you also wanna be with your-",reflection,2
"Well, there's a lot of things that seem fun in the moment that we know aren't a good choice, right? That's some of the things we talk about all the time is making good choices for our life and-and really doing what's best for you. And I just, you know, I really think you should think about making a big change here.",therapist_input,1
All right. Good.,other,3
"Well, I appreciate you thinking about it. I hope you'll think about it really hard. You know, this is something that I'm gonna continue to ask you about because it's something that really needs to change.",therapist_input,1
"So, but for right now, it sounds like the-- just having the pants fit better-",reflection,2
That's great. And how do you want to get the information on injecting?,question,0
"Well, you know, Tai Chi is one of the best ways to get your balance back after you've had something like a stroke. And it's also really good for preventing falls. And if you wanna be home and you wanna be doing the things you wanna do and going for walks with your dog, it's very important to make sure that you don't fall 'cause that would cause more problems down the road.",therapist_input,1
"Sure, sure. So you're noticing that the drinking at the moment is a way of perhaps calming the nerves?",reflection,2
"Oh, okay. Well, I appreciate that.",other,3
"Okay. And have you had any problems related to-to your drinking alcohol, like at home or school or somewhere else?",question,0
"-reward or stress relief. Um, and then, on the other hand, you've noticed, um, that your drinking has increased a little bit over time. And also that the more stressed you're fe- you feel, the more you're inclined to drink.",reflection,2
"And that sounds like a lot of excuses to me. So I feel like you had shared with me before that you do have a gym membership. So I think that's something that you just need to fit in your schedule. So for you to really see results that you want, my guess is you need to go about three to four times a week and really fit in that hour workout, um, on a daily basis.",therapist_input,1
"Yeah, I appreciate it. So, um, uh, your mom had given me a call and said that, um, um, there were some problems with kids kinda given you problems at school and being mean and things like that, and, uh, that's a hurtful thing.",therapist_input,1
Your mom.,reflection,2
Possibly-,other,3
"So, one or two weekends a month you're in a situation where there is alcohol?",reflection,2
"Right. Yeah. Um, so, you usually don't drink that much. Um, on an average, maybe a week, how much would you say you drink? Just--",question,0
How are you feeling today?,question,0
"Uh, that says a lot about you and your mom's relationship though that you can kind of put yourself in her head and think about how she would feel about it.",reflection,2
Mm. Yeah?,other,3
"There's no-- I don't think, any State or federal law that says.",therapist_input,1
"It's, uh, hard work to get into law school. Are you doing well in school? What kind of grades do you get?",question,0
"And that is something that we'd kinda like to see you do on your own, but if you're really feeling like you're struggling, those are phone calls that either you and I can make together or you and your case manager can make together.",therapist_input,1
-maybe? Is-- Can you elaborate on the part that you're maybe the most concerned about or that's the most on your mind right now?,question,0
"-they are so, um, they are so prejudicial. They really are. And I would check with the ACLU too. I mean, just as I-I don't know much, and now I'm very curious and I wanna find out about it myself, but yeah.",therapist_input,1
"-to try to get the inflammation down, so she doesn't need to go to the emergency room and do whatever you can at this point to keep the smoke off your clothes. And I think you're gonna see big changes in terms of, uh, her not needing to go to the emergency room, and you probably won't need to use the rescue inhaler hardly at all.",therapist_input,1
"Well, I mean that's-that's, you know, tell me about when you were diagnosed with that.",question,0
"So it kind of came a bit of a surprise, you feeling okay.",reflection,2
"Okay, and all of those things are true.",therapist_input,1
"-because you have to make sure that you're doing it safely or as safe as you can. And then, um, there can be some other consequences like throwing up or even if it's not you, that sometimes you're stuck your-your fun is sort of ruined when you're stuck dealing with a friend who drunk too much. Okay. And the other not so good things about the alcohol?",reflection,2
"So coming out, feeling-- being gay-",reflection,2
"So, it just kind of makes you feel relaxed or?",reflection,2
Mm-hmm. Okay. Yeah. So added to the other list is the having to go through the withdrawal-,reflection,2
"Okay. So it's not something you wanna rely on, you don't see yourself continuing to use this. It's something that you'v found at least for the moment very helpful?",reflection,2
I think you really need to quit.,therapist_input,1
"Fantastic. Thanks, Natalie.",other,3
"Yeah. So you're feeling a little betrayed like it didn't-- ""Look, and I did this, I was doing my Tai Chi, and all of a sudden, I- here, look at this, I fall.""",reflection,2
Why is that?,question,0
"Okay. Well, one of the things that-that we use are these-- it's kind of like a worksheet and it's an agenda-setting worksheet basically.",therapist_input,1
"And, uh, when your husband's away, which is something you don't like very much, sometimes, somehow, your symptoms then will seem greater. So, I guess what I'm wondering, Barbara, is if there might be some kind of a link with you between how you're feeling in your mind, and what's going on in your life, and-and how much your symptoms trouble you. Do you think that's a possibility?",reflection,2
Got it. So you've-you've had some pretty heavy drinking. What-what do you think is the most you've ever had?,question,0
Mm-hmm. You said the forms were confusing?,question,0
"It's really, your timing is [unintelligible 00:03:13]",reflection,2
"Well, the fact that he's having these ear infections is indicating to me that he is being exposed to smoke, and so, what can you tell me about that?",other,3
"All right, good. Well, here's your prescription. I even put it on autofill for you so it'll be ready at the same time every month for you. And if you have any questions later, our phone number is right here on the bottle, and you can call me at any time. Thanks so much. Have a great day.",therapist_input,1
"Okay. So, from your family perspective, the drinking is not something that fits very well?",reflection,2
What time would you need to get up then?,question,0
How much do you think you usually drink at a party?,question,0
"That's something that- that really matters to you and, um, I'm-I'm hearing you say that, you know, protecting your baby is important to you and at the same time, um, kind of clashes with some of the information that's in the brochure.",reflection,2
"-last night, are you?",question,0
"-talk to guys at the same time, on the other side it's not working you're finding. And i-i-it results in hangovers or?",reflection,2
Very clear you understand the whole idea of giving yourself a day off in between.,reflection,2
"You- you really need to take it, and-and like I said, the-the muscle weakness is rare. If you feel muscle weakness, just let your doctor know. He can take you off or switch. It's not permanent.",therapist_input,1
Yeah? Yeah. Sounds like a really strong definition of a good mate-,other,3
That makes- that makes a lot of sense. So then you'd have your money tucked away someplace different.,reflection,2
"Oh, I bet you're a really good cook then. Um, what would you think about a plan where you worked out an arrangement with this neighbor, where in exchange for her watching your son, you would prepare dinner for her and her, um, daughter?",therapist_input,1
"So, all these changes that you've- that you've made, um, Billy, where-where is the offending fitting into all of that now?",question,0
What's your thinking around that?,question,0
Okay. And so how else do you identify who your friends are that you can really trust who have your back?,question,0
"Respect, okay. Can you tell me a little bit about why you picked those three?",question,0
"Yeah. Probably if your friends won't quit drinking, you should just find new friends.",other,3
"I understand. So tell me, how often do you drink?",question,0
I want- I wanted to simply ask you how you feel about it?,question,0
"Yes, flossing.",reflection,2
"Mm-hmm. And that's a strong enough motivator for you and gives you enough purpose that you're willing to like kind of push through that fear that even though it's there and that, that sense of-",reflection,2
Okay. How else does injecting heroin impact your life?,question,0
"Yes, it is true. Yeah. It is. I mean, people don't come walking through the door who are not interested in it, you know? So, um, yeah, so that's-- So you'd be interested in something like that and, um, what- what other ideas have you thought about that would work for you?",question,0
Yeah. A lot of folks can't.,therapist_input,1
"Okay. Um, so maybe if it's okay with you, I can share with you some of, um, the requirements, maybe go over the details a little bit more.",other,3
"Yeah, yummy, so-",therapist_input,1
So whe-when-when are you gonna do it?,question,0
"Three weeks, isn't it?",question,0
"- and you've had some investigations, but you're not entirely happy that-that you haven't been investigated thoroughly enough.",reflection,2
"Mm-hmm. And so in terms of, uh, uh, readiness to actually go ahead and make a quit attempt, where do you think you fall on the scale of 1 to 10, where one is, I'm not considering it at all, and 10 is, I'm definitely ready, I wanna quit.",question,0
"So, um, looking back, Mike, uh, when was it that you started thinking that when you did use alcohol, um, most in your life?",question,0
"Yeah. Okay. So, I'm wondering how we can get to that point where, yeah, you can say, ""No, I don't wanna do that,"" and they're supportive of you?",question,0
"Okay, okay, so you've noticed over, I guess, uh, the last six months in particular since you decided, you know what? I'm going to take a risk and-a-and go out to try to meet a-a-a pot-potential partner again that it's with an increase in drinking.",reflection,2
"I'm wondering about the price of the YMCA compared to other gyms. Uh, is that one that you have an interest in or have looked at already?",therapist_input,1
"Uh-huh. Okay. So, on the one side, some of the fun things associated with alcohol are people are just more relaxed, sorta, um, carefree can kind of let loose a little bit more, on-on the other hand, there's a little bit more, I guess, planning involved-",reflection,2
"We'd-we'd-we'd have an illustration for them, I suppose. We call those high-risk situations. You know, it's that-- so you might learn some language about some sort of the way that we describe-",therapist_input,1
"Yeah, the fact that your drinking stands out from others is clearly not something you had ever really taken into consideration before?",reflection,2
"Okay. Well, so, you know, as someone who's not 21 yet, it is-- Underage drinking is something that's not legal-",therapist_input,1
"-so, what did it add up to, at the end of the day? What are we talking here?",question,0
Have you been here before?,question,0
Nothing. Okay.,reflection,2
How much are you drinking?,question,0
"Do you, um, do you ever use any prescription medicines that were not prescribed for you, or ever use your own prescriptions in a way on which they were not prescribed?",question,0
"So, you've got this dream by the sounds of it, which is, you know, to have a partner, and a house, and a nice car-",reflection,2
"Oh, after the six months.",reflection,2
"If you will. And that's if you decide you want to try a replacement therapy and that's what we call it and it-it kind of sounds from what you've described with your fear about you know, what it would be like of the withdrawal and everything like that. W-why you don't have to do it that way, you don't have to go cold-cold turkey.",therapist_input,1
- if I got the story right.,reflection,2
Inner harmony is number two?,question,0
"Okay. Can you tell me a little bit more about how, like, it's-it's not an issue for you?",question,0
And what-what happens next in terms of what happens once the forms are there?,question,0
"Yeah, I sense that. I sense that in you that you're--",reflection,2
And is that something that your daughter can do for you?,reflection,2
"But you're also not a 10, and that tells me that there may be some obstacles to your success. What would it take for you to be a 10 or even an 8 or 9?",question,0
"Okay, so I'm just gonna ask you a couple of more background questions.",therapist_input,1
"So it sounds a lot like, uh, on top of the fact that you've got something you're really scared about having consequences in terms of everything that can happen, what worries you also is all the different things that she told you you're going to need to do to get it under control. Can't imagine doing all those things, so you almost feel like all that bad stuff's gonna happen.",reflection,2
"Ready meals, and that sort of thing.",reflection,2
"So, you were able to keep the, uh, the journal?",question,0
Yeah. Is that something you'd be interested in?,question,0
Friends?,question,0
". So, um, tell me about the exercise.",question,0
Good for you doing that.,reflection,2
You're right. I don't know what it's like to be you and what I'm getting a sense of is that it's actually important that the person sitting opposite you in this role needs to understand what it's like to be you. Is that right?,therapist_input,1
That would work for you?,question,0
"Well, Nina, you know yourself best, and you know, you know, you know what your world looks like and what those, you know, like, you know the support that your friends give you and the support that you get from your family, you know that. And I-I really just wanna support you in being able to make those choices and have those conversations, and I wanna do whatever I can to support you with that. Um, and I'm just wondering if maybe we can kind of pick this up, um, in a next visit, but before we go there, I'm just wondering, is there some steps that you would be willing to kind of take or consider, uh, with-with regards to your drinking?",question,0
Ah.,other,3
"So you're at the second thought part. And what do you think would-- might take you, uh, over to actually doing it if you wanted to?",question,0
"Right. By the way, binge drinking is defined for women as having more than, uh, three drinks and there are about five drinks in a bottle. So, you enjoy drinking wine because it helps make things, uh, a little bit more interesting when you're feeling down but at the same time you don't like drinking when you have more than you want it to and then the depression returns after you drink.",reflection,2
"Yeah. He wasn't too happy with the exam, was he Hailey?",question,0
That's awesome. And you play tenor sax?,question,0
I'm wondering what else might be on that list.,question,0
A couple of times a week. And where do you get your syringes?,question,0
Mm. Sure.,other,3
And it was fun at first. But now you're already noticing some consequences.,reflection,2
"Sarah, I'm so glad you came in for your well-woman exam today. I think we addressed a lot of your concerns. However, I would like to ask you more about your smoking. Would that be okay?",question,0
"I guess I would just have a tendency to say it. I'm a recovering person, and back in my former life, I have a felony conviction. And before we go any further, I don't wanna waste your time. Uh, would that be a problem in even getting the interview, what would you think about saying something like that?",therapist_input,1
"A little bit bigger, perhaps doesn't look after himself that well, and he fits that foot",reflection,2
"And, um, I think you should probably stop as soon as possible, like this weekend.",therapist_input,1
"So, what number do you think you'd say?",question,0
You're a lucky man.,reflection,2
So you're not proud of finishing a bottle?,question,0
"Okay. Well thanks for listening, and honestly, I- I am really worried about the smoking, so--",therapist_input,1
"Yeah. You want to stay healthy. I'm curious, what do you like about using heroin?",question,0
"Okay, well, I'd be happy to talk to you more about that and give you some tips and advice and give you some suggestions about where you can get some support with quitting.",therapist_input,1
"Okay, and the three- the three other ones, inner harmony-- Let me see if I can remember them. Inner harmony, health and, what was the other one?",question,0
"All right, so I'll see you next week.",other,3
Uh.,other,3
All right. Thank you so much.,other,3
"1,003 kids.",other,3
W-why was that? Why was that helpful?,question,0
"Okay, I mean what do you think that next step is?",therapist_input,1
Yeah. Mm. How would you like it to be?,question,0
-so I'm wondering where you are around your writing and you're reading?,question,0
"-what's next. Right. Okay. So, I mean, there is certainly a lot of evidence that pets in the home and the dander from their fur can make asthma worse.",therapist_input,1
Do you know what-,question,0
How do you think it affects you?,question,0
"From your GP, yeah.",reflection,2
-and a little bit more connection maybe that-,other,3
-and that relationship was important to you.,reflection,2
"You've done-- You've got a really good track record of, uh, being on time. Yeah? Do you realize that?",other,3
That's okay with me.,therapist_input,1
What you're kind of thinking about what those might.,reflection,2
"I'm happy with that. What do you think will happen, what might happen if you can turn your-your uses- you're on now? What-what concerns do you have about not making any kind of change?",question,0
"Hey, Mary, how are you?",question,0
"Great, Kaylie. I know we went over a lot today. What other questions do you have for me?",question,0
"So he mentioned, it might be a family thing. And so you-",reflection,2
"Uh, it's something that just happened.",reflection,2
"Well, you're not alone, a lot of people think that drinking helps them sleep better, and in reality, drinking might make you fall asleep faster, but it has what's called this rebound effect, and this rebound effect means that you wake up, may, might wake up in the middle of the night or early in the morning and have a hard time falling back asleep.",therapist_input,1
And the sugar in it helps too.,reflection,2
"Okay, okay, so you’re thinking about perhaps looking at trying to keep weekdays free of alcohol? Was that what you were saying?",therapist_input,1
"Okay. yeah, it was weird when I, uh, got that report because for the most part since you've been here, uh, you'd been like, uh, model-model resident, uh, always making their bed, uh, been pretty, uh, respectful of the staff, of all the other residents. So, uh, is it something to do with you getting out in three weeks? It must be pretty hard.",reflection,2
So it's hard for you to quit smoking when everybody else around you is smoking. And it's so easy to go out and take a break and have a cigarette.,reflection,2
"So you know there's a part of you going, I was thinking in this place that's hard work.",reflection,2
"Okay. So you said that, um, your difficulties are getting in the way of you doing certain things. So they're, they're stopping you from taking up kind of certain types of work and as a freelance photographer, I guess that- that can be kind of a problem. And they're also stopping you or you feel like it's stunting you, uh, socially. You're not kind of able to make new friends and get to meet new people.",reflection,2
"Hindsight? Oh, yeah, they'll-- it'll take the- it'll take the blame. Um, so, you still-- Do you still, uh, you know, you started drinking again, and then, um, the second DUI, what-- Is it the same circle of social-social circle, same friends?",question,0
"Right. And then with the respect, one of the things you mentioned, is really wanting to respect yourself and not sort of cross boundaries, not sort of cross lines.",reflection,2
"As your provider, I'm a little concerned about your health. Drinking alcohol could harm you, and I would like to share some information with you. Is that okay?",question,0
[inaudible 00:06:01],other,3
You're up for the challenge?,reflection,2
Right. Okay. So you're looking for some-something that's reasonably priced-,reflection,2
So I wrote a prescription for antibiotics for Aiden.,therapist_input,1
Okay. [chuckles],other,3
I know.,other,3
You get peace with yourself?,reflection,2
"Let's take a look. It says that on occasion you use, uh, drugs other than medical reasons. Which drugs do you use?",question,0
Okay. So to what levels do you think you could do that? Where-where would you wanna go with your drinking?,question,0
Yeah? Okay.,reflection,2
And so this chronic inhaler can really prevent that from happening. Okay? Which is why it's so important to use it.,therapist_input,1
"Um, before we get into that, I see you filled out our annual screening forms here. So if-if you're okay, can we take a minute to talk about that?",question,0
Um-,other,3
Okay. What do you think you'll miss most about it?,question,0
"You're trying to stay put, you're not driving. You're trying to stay with people that you trust. Um, but yet it sounds like there's still some-some things happening from time to time.",reflection,2
"It does make sense, yeah.",other,3
"And so you did your clarifications, value clarifications-",question,0
"Okay, fine. You know what? We've got one really good lead with the neighbor. I think if you would follow up in pursuing that, you might find some relief and resolve some of your childcare issues. Um, how many days a week are you in school?",therapist_input,1
So why don't you start by telling me a little bit about yourself?,question,0
"What are some of the reasons why, um, it would be good for you to kinda make this change?",question,0
"Good to see you here. I see on your file that you're, uh, [unintelligible 00:01:18].",other,3
"You know. And, um-- So and for you, friends that, um, kind of, um, give you the attention that you'd like to have. Texting you-",reflection,2
"From your perspective, things are going well?",reflection,2
"And at the same time, it's-it's linked closely with the- with the drug scene with the meth scene for you?",question,0
"But before we get to anything, I'll probably want to just ask you a little bit about what's led you to come here today and get a bit of an idea about what's been going on for you.",other,3
"Oh, absolutely.",other,3
Yep.,other,3
"So, I'm wondering if something happened that that led you not to go. You look a little, um, down.",question,0
So I'm hearing there are some things you really like about smoking. What about the other side? Can you tell me about some of the not-so-good things?,reflection,2
"-whereas like, you can't go up to him and say, ""Hey, can I have some of your McDonald's French fries,"" and take them out—",reflection,2
Okay. Is it okay if I share some information with you?,question,0
"Kind of, as your.",other,3
"Oh, yeah, yeah.",other,3
"Yeah. Is-- are your friends the problem, like maybe you should just start hanging out with more kids in the youth group and not hang out with those kids that you were partying with?",therapist_input,1
Okay. And-and how far away is it from your house?,question,0
So do you think doing this program and completing this program this time would be a good place to start?,question,0
"Okay. So, again, that, sort of, sounds really important. So, what's-what's your dreams? What are your dreams? Where do you wanna be in five years' time? Where does Catherine wanna be? What do you wanna be doing? What are your dreams?",question,0
"Okay. Well, it sounds like you realized that when you lost the weight you feel better and that it's gonna affect your overall health. So, tell me what you think changed that caused you to gain the weight back.",reflection,2
Ringing him?,question,0
"Well, I'm glad to hear that you have a goal of quitting for a month and you are confident of reaching that goal. If you're willing to come back in a month or so, I would be curious to hear how your plan works out.",therapist_input,1
"You know, like college is gonna be really hard. And especially with all those pre-med classes, you're not gonna be able to handle it drinking this much. You know, have you thought about that?",question,0
So you have a support group that gives you the ability to have fun and still drink below risk levels?,reflection,2
And see what happens.,reflection,2
You're keeping the door open-,reflection,2
"Who-who-who, boys?",question,0
What would she say about—,question,0
Mm-hmm. So kind of 9:00 to 5:00 sort of job.,reflection,2
Sounds like a wild night.,reflection,2
"So, it's something you just aren't willing to do?",question,0
It's become a more important part of your life because you found yourself smoking at times that you thought I'll never smoke then.,reflection,2
"Sometimes it's the small things that really count, too.",reflection,2
"Well things like heart disease, cancer, liver problems, uh, stomach pains, insomnia. Unfortunately, uh, people who drink at a risky level are more likely to be diagnosed with depression and alcohol can make depression worse or harder to treat.",therapist_input,1
"Um, and I'd like to us- for us to meet again, so to catch up with you and make an appointment before you leave. Just to see how things are going and-",therapist_input,1
"How important is it to you to make, uh, an adjustment in your drinking or even to quit?",question,0
"Thanks. When I looked at your form, it looks like you use heroin weekly and you injected. What part of your body do you normally inject in?",therapist_input,1
"-on that. All right. So, I'd like to ask you, uh, kind of a scaling question about this 'cause I'm hearing that this feels really important to you that you'd be way up there on the high- on the high end of importance.",reflection,2
"So, at the moment, it's been a case of the last six months, this is a pattern that you’ve been noticing more and more, um, a sign that it has had negative impacts on your lifestyle which you’re not happy with and you are in you're in a position where, you know what? I wanna do something about it.",reflection,2
"Okay. I see on the questionnaire that you have not ridden in a car with someone who's been drinking and you haven't driven a car, um, after you've been drinking. Is that correct?",therapist_input,1
Okay. A drink or two. So about how many drinks would you say you have over the course of a day?,question,0
"-you can tell them to stop too. You know, then that'd be really good. You'd being a good friend.",other,3
Could be?,question,0
That’s what it seems like.,reflection,2
Yeah. Don't put words in your mouth. I'm sure if that is—,reflection,2
"Okay. So something's changed in your relationship between you, yeah?",question,0
You're doing the best you can do.,reflection,2
That sounds like a great plan.,reflection,2
"Yeah. When you get uh, a headache.",reflection,2
"Come on, Hailey. You're here because you thought he had pneumonia. You're telling me that Jake can't breathe, you're concerned about his breathing. And then you just slip in the fact that you're smoking cigarettes and you think there's no relationship? Do I really need to review all the risks of smoking in front of your-your child or exposing him to secondhand smoke not to mention the risks that you're posing to yourself and your own health?",question,0
"And, I suppose, our own personalized a little bit like that, there's lots of different aspects that need to be tweaked.",therapist_input,1
"So when I see you next time, you know, that's what I'd like you to do is to, uh, experiment with getting up an hour earlier and, um-- You know, 'cause, uh, getting healthier is more important than sleep, you know. I mean, I know sleep is important, but-- And then bring that list back that we talked about.",therapist_input,1
"Yeah. I'm confused though at the moment because you're saying, ""Yeah, I could make in a night what you make in a week,"" but you've haven't. 22-22 days-",reflection,2
With the libido out the door.,reflection,2
"Then, who are- who-who-who are they?",question,0
-might have probably helped you break your fall this time.,therapist_input,1
"Mm-hmm. Okay. Well, that's a good place to start. So, I heard you say your health is important, and you're getting ready to run a marathon, so you wanna be able to do what you can to make that successful. And you also were a little bit surprised that you fell into this risky or hazardous category.",reflection,2
-and get you into trouble.,reflection,2
And how are you a burden now?,question,0
"So, uh, uh, a portion of the time it's working well for you and another portion of the time maybe you would like-",reflection,2
"Mm. So, embraces this life of the picket fence and the, you know, the little house and having the baby in this-",reflection,2
Okay. Have you had any major stressful events recently or any change in your work situation?,question,0
"Yeah? But, what would-",question,0
O-on a scale of 1 to 10 where one is not at all 10 is completely what number would you give.,question,0
So you've taken that into account that-,reflection,2
"Rejection-rejection, yeah.",reflection,2
"Inner harmony, health, and security.",reflection,2
Okay. Okay. And how about going to see the doctor? Have you gone to-- for a visit or anything recently?,question,0
"Good. So how would you go about getting them to support you, to come on board, and be accountable to doing this work together?",question,0
"Okay. I think that sounds like a great step for you as your doctor. Why don't we revisit this the next time you come in to talk about your blood pressure in about six weeks or so and, um, then we can see how you're doing with it.",therapist_input,1
"Okay. So just to-to make sure that I've got the-the story straight, you've-you've seen Dr. Brown for a couple of years.",reflection,2
Especially in the church.,reflection,2
"Yeah. Well, and, David, honestly, wherever you're at, we'll work with it.",therapist_input,1
What is it that he's said that he thinks might be wrong with you?,question,0
"Oh, wow. Okay, that's exciting.",reflection,2
"Yeah, I understand that your intention was to have a good time while watching the game with your friends. You didn't think about what could go wrong when you drank alcohol underage because you were at your friend's house and not a big party and you made an effort to be safe by finding a ride home.",reflection,2
"Okay. I see that you filled out our, um, alcohol and drug questionnaire. Is it okay if we go through this together?",other,3
"-and then, um- and then it would be up to you mostly. The choice is-is completely yours. And, um, it sounds like to me that there's no reason why you wouldn't be able to do this. You've given it a lot of thought, and you have some plans in place, and anything else that you might come up with, uh, to help you stay out of the driver's seat when you've been drinking.",other,3
And you've been talking about that a lot lately. So I really-,reflection,2
And before you've been putting it off.,reflection,2
"- and then there'll be absolutely no waiting. And, the purpose of that- of that visit will be to have a look at how you really feel about how you could move forward, and somehow fit in a more healthier lifestyle into the busy work life that you've got.",other,3
"Yeah. 'Cause it looks like you need to just take your medicine, uh, uh, once a day from-from the prescription. So that sounds doable right now.",therapist_input,1
Yeah. So we're noticing some pretty negative effects in terms of your oral health with the smoking. Are there any other things that you're concerned about?,reflection,2
"Your behavior is not what Minnesota State University expects of its students. If you wanna be a student here, you'll need to show that you're able to follow our rules. Do you think you can do that, otherwise, you'll be suspended?",therapist_input,1
"Okay. So, are there any other barriers or obstacles in the way to you getting to tai chi?",question,0
"Mm-hmm. Well, you do need to take your medicine. We, uh, will need to start dieting, uh, you know, lose some weight, change-change your eating habits, exercise, uh, to get your diabetes under control, because your doctor is right, it is very serious.",therapist_input,1
"Tell me a little bit about what now and again means, and-and-and how often.",question,0
"Okay, and those are ones that are pretty related to each other-",reflection,2
"Okay. All right. Well, kind of keeping that in mind, it sounds like, um, you do have sort of a-a vague plan to make some adjustments in your drinking at some point-",reflection,2
Well you said before you had an opportunity to pick up and start dealing again.,reflection,2
Okay. I don't know if it'd be helpful for you if you'd like to know a little bit more about some of the factors involved in time Type II diabetes.,other,3
"So, you haven't seen the results that you want yet-",reflection,2
Right. Right.,other,3
"And how did this happen is probably kind of what you're also thinking. Well, how did this--?",reflection,2
Good. Anybody else in your family that would be really proud of-- that you're taking these steps?,question,0
Yeah. What would happen if she wasn't around say or at a party or?,question,0
Great. I'll see you then.,other,3
Right. Right. So you were hoping that I'd send you for more tests?,question,0
"Okay. Um, before I leave today is there anything else you'd like to add or-or need to share with me?",other,3
And so what about your drinking do you not like or is there anything that worries you about your drinking?,question,0
"You're not alone in feeling that way. Uh, binge drinking can feel normal to some people.",reflection,2
You would have been fine if they didn't- if they didn't give you those-those shots. Yeah.,reflection,2
"So, Jacob, everything looks very normal on your physical exam. Do you have any questions for me?",question,0
"Okay. So, that's something that you've sort of made a decision about. It sound like you—",reflection,2
But this has affected it.,reflection,2
"And you wanna be, um, take care of your baby as the baby's growing.",reflection,2
"So that might work for him, but what might work for you?",question,0
How can I help you with these things?,question,0
"Great. So, being a good friend and-",reflection,2
"Right. It's like your private place and, you know, it's-- that's-- it's your stuff.",reflection,2
"And if-- Well, there's a number of-- We're not entirely sure, there's a lot of research still going on as to how this happens and how that could be modified. But what we do know is that, um, one of the key things in managing it is to try and modify or modulate, control the amount of sugar that are in your system.",therapist_input,1
But we're talking about it.,other,3
"Okay, well, I-I hope you really listen to what I'm telling you about her using that chronic inhaler, and I hope you consider quitting smoking.",therapist_input,1
"Yeah. And, um, and at the time the big crisis was actually maybe prison and all the crisis around the arrest and-and, uh, you know, it's like you're a leper and the leper colony.",reflection,2
And you're not feeling so good about that?,reflection,2
"Yeah. Chris, come on. You're getting peer pressure?",therapist_input,1
"Okay. So, and then your friends drink too?",question,0
"Okay. So what ideas do you have, Natalie for, um, getting started in adding more physical activity?",question,0
Sorry?,other,3
"There you go. Okay, yeah. So, that, y-yeah.",other,3
"Okay, I, you know, I-I don't want to argue with you about this. I-I know that if you-you know, and if you want to keep Sarah out of the emergency room, uh, I-I just wish you'd heed what I'm saying. She needs to use that chronic inhaler every day to get her- to get her asthma under control, and the smoke on your clothes and the smoking flares her asthma up. So she really needs to use that chronic inhaler, and you really need to think about quitting smoking.",therapist_input,1
Okay. Okay. So you're saying about 50-50?,question,0
"Um, I-I'm reluctant to give a prescription for that because I think it's really up to you. And I think it depends on how things go, as to how much you need to do.",therapist_input,1
"But otherwise, again it's rare, and it's completely reversible if you let us know.",other,3
-saying-,reflection,2

If I could draw an analogy, a grape and a watermelon are in the same family of fruits, you know, and obviously, grape is much smaller than a watermelon. And if you eat one grape, you'd be fine. If you ate an entire watermelon, it can make you very sick. If we look at the grape as the medicine your daughter's taking, again, it's in the same broad family, the amount of drug that your daughter is getting is very small. Uh, and not only that it's not an anabolic steroid, even though it's in the same big family. And what this drug does is actually reduces the inflammation in your daughter's lungs. And-and it doesn't even get absorbed into the body. It only goes to her lungs. And as I said, I wouldn't want your daughter taking a medication that could have the impact of those anabolic steroids. This is really safe for your daughter to use. So what-what are your thoughts about considering having her using this?",therapist_input,1

"Okay. And on a regular night, how much do you-- how many glasses of wine would you guess you drink?",question,0
"Um, so the way this normally works is, you know, we set you a goal, and then I'll have you come back and we'll talk about it again in a couple of weeks and make sure that you actually stopped. Um, and so what do you think about that?",therapist_input,1
You have a lot of things going on and smoking's kind of a way to relax and destress.,reflection,2

"Yeah. So there's a couple of things that we know that people with Type II diabetes have to look after and have to think about if they want to control the amount of sugar that's in their system, which is the main issue that's causing some of the health problems that people have with Type II diabetes. Too much sugar, and if it's not able to be utilized in the blood cell, in the fat cells, or liver cells, and the muscle cells stays in your bloodstream. And that can cause problems with your circulation. So too high blood sugar and too low a blood sugar can be a problem. So sugar is the main concern in Type II- Type II diabetes.And you mentioned earlier on, a couple of things that the doctor-- You've mentioned some signs that he was kind of a little bit concerned about.

"So, in that experience, it really built up your self-confidence and it almost not only changed the way you saw yourself, but maybe how other people saw you and you really, you liked that feeling.",reflection,2
"Right. Well, that's a lot of information to think about. So given, the fact that these healthcare concerns are a possibility, and that you're worried about your family and you certainly have goals you want to succeed at, where are you in your consideration to making a change? In other words, what steps would you consider taking for this number to move closer to a 10?",question,0
-and to keep you there and to keep you feeling safe.,therapist_input,1
"Okay. Um, and so what I hear is that you're-- you feel like your wife might be, uh, overreacting to this?",reflection,2
"No, I guess that that would be the end of your, uh, shaking and moving. I know-- I wonder if you'd be open to exploring your alcohol use and what that looks like during the week.",question,0
"Yeah, okay. So I'm noticing that this isn't the first time that you've been to see someone at probation and it's not your first, um, community sentence. So I was wondering when you're sitting on the bus thinking about coming here, what was- what was going through your head about being here?",question,0
"So thanks for coming in, Sandra. We'll see you next week.",reflection,2
"Yeah, because worry's no fun.",other,3
- the herbal shop-,other,3
"This, it-- What-what-what was different?",question,0
"Yeah, how doesn't it fit, Billy?",question,0
Chewing gum.,other,3
It-- I believe it is.,therapist_input,1
"Uh-huh. So, you're hoping that it would help with balance, but you didn't see the- maybe the results you were looking for?",reflection,2
"So your days are just as full now that you're working and a career person, um, and your energy level isn't what it used to be. What-- Do you have any ideas about why that might have shifted?",question,0
"Not just authority, but respecting yourself, respecting your teammates or your bandmates and other people around you. Okay, that's great.",reflection,2
Would you be interested in perhaps thinking about setting a goal with respect to your drinking?,question,0
He said that it would help you with some of the pain that you've been having.,reflection,2
That's correct. And writing it down helps that process.,therapist_input,1
What did you find out?,question,0
"Oh, that-that sounds like it would be great if you were able to do that. Obviously, don't smoke in the house, you know- you know.",therapist_input,1
-trying to get a handle on that.,question,0
"So you felt like, um, the information that you found supports the values that you have of being able to be independent and autonomous, to be able to make your own choice and the information that your doctor shared or spoke to you about, and then this brochure kind of feels like that's challenging sort of your values.",reflection,2
"Hello, Kaylie. I see you're here to pick up a prescription today.",other,3
"Yeah, yeah, that's, um, and that- that's not easy for you, because you- you'd like to go really soon, and here I am asking you to spend just a couple of minutes with me.",other,3
"And what I also hear you saying, it's possibly the-- It's now possibly more possible, in your mind, that you could make some of these changes, rather than bring broad-brush, you know, huge changes to your lifestyles. It's not about changing who you are, it's not changing huge facets of your life, but maybe small steps that need to be taken.",reflection,2
You feel like you're letting your family down.,reflection,2
"Okay. That's perfect because cholesterol statin works best if it's taken at night, though you can take it any time of the day. And you should take it every single day. It's important to keep that up. Where do you store your medications?",therapist_input,1
"Yeah, that makes sense? Yeah? So how confident are you that-that, you know, you can sort out the issues related to, um, you know, uh, taking the money from your employer? And another thing, in your precinct's report, there were some issues around gambling, and some issues around alcohol use. So those seem to be important issues that are kind of getting out. So how confident are you that you can get those sorted in the nine months we've got?",question,0
"Okay. Okay. Okay. Yeah, yeah. So, you were saying before that, you know, there was, you know, money you couldn't really afford-",reflection,2
You got your lip pierced. How long ago did you get that done?,question,0
What else has brought you here?,other,3
"You need insulin in your cells, individual cells in muscle or in fat or wherever to, um, use up excess sugar or to utilize sugar.",therapist_input,1
"So you told yourself you wouldn't, so you're once you- you're the sort of guy that once you make a decision you're gonna go, you're staunch with that decision?",question,0
"And before you leave, uh, is it okay if we go over this screening form that you filled out today on your alcohol use?",question,0
"W-what was, do you mean you kind of try to hide behind it or?",question,0
Alright.,other,3
"-interested in what your thoughts are, Sarah.",question,0
"Okay. So, uh, before vaccines were developed, often when children had a natural exposure to some of these diseases, they ended up with, uh, sometimes death, disability, measles caused brain damage and, uh, deafness and blindness. Polio caused, uh, paralysis in children. And so, allowing children to have natural exposure to these diseases, sometimes was a little bit of a gamble, it could be dangerous.",therapist_input,1
Mm. Mm-hmm.,other,3
Do you think that's enough to make you say goodbye to cigarettes?,question,0
As to what-,question,0
"So, it sounds like you've already been thinking about, uh, ways to-to get around safely.",reflection,2
Would it be helpful to give you some information on low risk drinking guidelines?,question,0
"Well, the cost is free and the counseling services we provide, we are legally obligated to protect your privacy. We can't tell your parents. There are some exceptions to that privacy rule, including, uh, mostly if we're concerned about- that your safety.",therapist_input,1
"So, you've been able to cut down by two or three cigarettes? That's amazing. I mean, given how much you were smoking.",reflection,2
"So on the one hand, you're worried about how your smoking might be affecting him and on the other hand, you're not so sure if it's really the smoking that's causing these problems?",reflection,2
"Oh, no.",other,3
Never lasts. Mm. You seem like a bit of a crossroads to me.,reflection,2
Exactly.,other,3
So think about when you were-- This-this is an interesting question to see what you think. You were- you were a coach. You-- Maybe you'll be a coach again.,reflection,2
And you said you kind of don't fit that kinda Type II diabetes look. That you kinda have had this idea-,reflection,2
Can you think of any other downsides to smoking pot?,question,0
"Yeah. Well, um, first of all, I really am passionate about looking at the whole picture, um, physical health and emotional wellbeing and what I found in working with clients in the past is when, um, we make a focus of weight loss, sometimes, uh, physical health improves, but at the cost of emotional wellbeing.",therapist_input,1
"-so don't forget the nice car, and some kids, and be a- be a good dad-",reflection,2
"All right. So, you're not a zero. So, that tells me that you've got some confidence that this is doable, this is something you certainly can do it. Why are you not a zero?",question,0
"Okay. Barbara, what was it that you were hoping that I'd do for you today?",question,0
"Hi, Mrs. Smith. I'm Denise. I'm the social worker here at the clinic work that's working with Dr. Fields and the rest of the team. And, um, I know you were here to see Dr. Fields today, and I-I just wanted to let you know, I usually work with people who are similar to- have situations similar to you, and that have gone back home from rehab. And, uh, so I'd like to find out a little bit if you would, if that's okay, about how it's been going since you got home.",therapist_input,1
Okay. And I'm wondering if you have any concerns about that.,reflection,2
The side effects from the medications are nothing compared to what can happen from the smoking.,therapist_input,1
"I'm sure there's so many other places you'd rather be than here today talking with me, but, um, you're here, and, um, thank you.",other,3
"Okay. Just sort of interested, when you rang your mom and, um, told her what's happening, how difficult was it to talk about the issue of violence and being violent towards your partner?",question,0
This is gonna be your career. This is the career-,reflection,2
"Okay. So, you-you wanna look good, you know, and she's proud of you I'm sure anyway and then this just would be an added benefit. Yeah.",reflection,2
"Cholesterol good, your weight is good.",reflection,2
"You've got the time at the end of the day when you finish work, which might be the first time you've gone without a cigarette. So, what I'd like to recommend is that you use two products perhaps and I'm thinking of you're having a patch and then suggesting that you might use something that you can top up with. Often, a person who smokes knows exactly what it feels like when they're craving for a cigarette. What does it feel like to you, when you can't have a cigarette and you want one?",therapist_input,1
"So, I was thinking about how that stuff about not feeling confident around reading and writing has, um, really got in the way for you.",reflection,2
"Yeah. And any other relationship, if you don't mind me asking-- [crosstalk]",question,0
"Science fair project or not, don't you know what happens when someone drives under the influence of marijuana or alcohol? It's bad. They can wreck the car, you can lose your life. I thought you were smart, you're taking AP classes, you wanna get into a Ivy League school. This is not the way you do that.",therapist_input,1
"Yeah. And so that might mean, you know, like giving up an hour's sleep, getting up an hour earlier in the day, and going there and getting it done then. That's what I do.",therapist_input,1
Okay. And he's a truck driver?,question,0
Great. Who could help you reach this goal?,question,0
Glamourous.,reflection,2
Me too. Walking is great exercise.,therapist_input,1
"That's fantastic, Billy.",other,3
True.,other,3
"So, we were, um- we were just talking a little bit about sustained talk, which most people call denial.",therapist_input,1
"So, it strikes me that the way that we're talking about it, it's like it's all or nothing. Either you keep smoking the way you are, things continue to go downhill and get worse, your wife gets more and more on your case, or you put your cigarettes down starting the moment you walk in the door tonight and never pick them up again. It's almost like one or the other. It strikes me that as well there might be some middle ground here that it took you a long time to learn how to be a smoker and maybe it's going to take some time to learn how to stop smoking.",reflection,2
Since the co- the court sent you and we have to sort of explore what would happen if you went out and did this again.,therapist_input,1
People can't read-- People can't read your handwriting?,question,0
Tell me a bit more about that.,question,0
Yeah? Good.,other,3
"Right, they weren't looking out for your best interest at that point.",reflection,2
When you've had a few drinks and you kind of go and get into trouble. How would you like that to be different?,question,0
"Okay. So it sounds like you're drinking about four times a week, anywhere between three and eight drinks on a given day. So, maybe around 20 drinks a week?",question,0
So you're feeling uncomfortable with changes in your body?,reflection,2
"Okay. So you had a pretty strong self-confidence, pretty strong body image all the way up until a few months ago and, um, you're hoping to kind of get back to that place where you feel good about yourself.",reflection,2
Yeah. So we'll go ahead and get both of those prescriptions ready.,therapist_input,1
So you're holding the camera very tightly.,reflection,2
Doctor mentioned that as being a factor.,reflection,2
"Like I said, it's been, um, a long time and this is basically the first time that we've seen this behavior from you, so I know for a lot of other guys right before they get out, uh, a lot of anxiety, a lot of frustration comes around because they haven't been out in a while and then like the pressures of being on the outside are starting to settle in. So is that something might be going on with you?",reflection,2
"So, how much reading and writing is involved in the course that you're gonna go on?",question,0
Yeah. Your is mum still down south?,question,0
"-and, no one's going to tell you what to do.",reflection,2
"Well, thank you, Tanya, for meeting with me today and talking about this. So, there is something I'd like to ask you that we can kind of discuss in our conversation is what's one thing about yourself or something in your life that you'd like to change that maybe you've been feeling kind of ambivalent about?",therapist_input,1
Okay. So getting to school for your first hour is something that you're going to work on as your goal.,reflection,2
"And, um, so you were-- You said that you’ve been going several times a week, which is really an extraordinary number, I-I think it’s four, five times a week?",question,0
"Mm. Okay, so that's-that's the kind of support that a really good mate would give you? It sounds-",other,3
Mm-hmm. So about half the time you're drinking and half the time you're not. Can you tell me what's different about the days when you choose to drink versus not to drink?,question,0
"Hi, Jean. I'm Dr. Selby. Nice to meet you.",other,3
"Uh, so, uh, would people come and drink at your house, and then they would be fine with that?",question,0
"Okay, so you wanna kind of get some action, don't wanna sit around-",reflection,2
"Yeah. What do you think it'd be like for your kids if they were sitting here now and they heard you say that this was really, really important to you and to them? That you gave this program 100%. Well, then what might that be like for them to hear that?",question,0
"Thanks for coming in and talking with me for a couple of minutes. I understand you don't have very much time, but I really appreciate you stopping by.",reflection,2
"All right, Well, first I'd just like to commend you for your honesty and that's really helpful information that you shared with me. Thank you for letting me know that you're smoking again and-and, um, I also appreciate the fact you're taking so many measures to protect your son from secondhand smoke. Can I give you some advice on how you could protect him, even the- even further?",question,0
"Okay, so the end of the day-",reflection,2
"Well, according to your chart, your blood pressure has gone up since July, and you said that you've been drinking more recently, so do you see the connection there?",therapist_input,1
"Okay. Well, then that sounds like a perfect location for you. Medicines keep best if they're stored away from light and heat and moisture. What did the doctor tell you to expect in terms of side effects?",question,0
"Do you mind if I take a look at your arm, please?",question,0
Yeah. So why should she go through yours?,reflection,2
- from the-the herbal shop. None of them really made a great deal of difference. You've had some investigations-,reflection,2
"Okay. All right, so-so one of the challenges is for us to be talking about things that interest you. Yeah.",therapist_input,1
"Well, that is a bummer. I mean—",reflection,2
"Mm-hmm, kind of feels like, you know, you were making some really good decisions about your baby. You've done research and you wanna be able to bring your baby up well and take care of your baby. And I-I can see that that's really important to you. I hear you saying that and it kind of feels like this information isn't kind of what you were expecting to hear.",reflection,2
Okay. What could you do to avoid getting into trouble?,question,0
"Well, have you got the forms with you?",question,0
"Right. So the one hand you've-you-you could sit yourself up and-and take the risk, but on the other hand, you know, that actually it might not last?",reflection,2
Are there any other concerns that you have about Methamphetamine?,question,0
"Yeah? Yeah. Yep. So, it seems like almost, like, you're still in the behavior, you know, still creating some problems?",question,0
"So, let me make sure I understand kind of the whole scenario 'cause there's a lot of pieces to it. Your wife is on your case and your kids are ganging up too. So, you're sort of isolated, you're put in a corner and you're being told this is something you have to do, you have no choice in the matter.",reflection,2
So what do you think about Tai Chi? Is that something you think you might be able to try sometime?,question,0
Yeah? Yeah.,other,3
"Okay. So, can I share with you some information on alcohol use?",question,0
Okay. I'd like to hear how your plan worked out for you if you're willing to come back for another appointment. I look forward to hearing about what worked for you and what was challenging say in four weeks.,other,3
Okay. I wonder if I could raise the subject of your weight.,question,0
Hmm. Can you tell me more about your concerns about vaccines?,question,0
Yeah. And there is and I'm sure that it is really struggling at times too.,reflection,2
Okay. So why don't you tell me what you remember from having your conversation with your case manager? What do you know so far about community service?,question,0
"Okay. You know it seems like you had uh, a day at school. I noticed that uh, you missed your first hour of class today as well.",therapist_input,1
"So, um, everyone that comes on the South Whisky program, we'd like them to pick at least three goals that they'd like to work on in the next 30 days. Because what we will do is we will monitor you and we'll check in 30 days to see how you're going with your goals. So with that being said, we want you to pick something that is relevant for you, something that you're willing to work on. So with that being said, is there anything that you would like to change your work on either at home or school, um, [unintelligible 00:00:30]?",question,0
-to think about looking after yourself a bit more.,reflection,2
"Okay. So it's kind of linked to your drinking, the fact that, um, that you can-- if you can take care of that drinking, you can take care of the-",reflection,2
Okay. So you're sort of looking for that balance-,reflection,2
"Yeah. What does it tell me about you as a man, as a father, as someone who wants to get moving?",question,0
"At the time it was important, yeah.",reflection,2
Yeah. What are you really glad about?,question,0
"So, it's already piled I'm thinking up for you, you don't need anything else so you're looking for some relief and not something to make you feel worse.",reflection,2
"So here you are today and, um, you're sharing that you have been drinking alcohol throughout your pregnancy.",reflection,2
"Yeah, you know, I get it. Like, we've all been there. Okay. You know, I was in high school ones too, you know, I drank too. I get it. There's not a ton to do in this town a-and kids drink, but, you know, promise we have these rules-",therapist_input,1
Yeah. So w-where do you think you can start with that?,question,0
"Mm-hmm. So, what have you looked into about, um, you know, advocacy in that area or expungement or anything like that?",therapist_input,1
"So-So again, I'm-I'm wondering about this other world, and you're saying it doesn't look to attractive at the moment.",reflection,2
In what way have you gotten a little bit better?,question,0
"And ah, hang on.",reflection,2
"Okay, so, the-the alcohol is something that might make it harder to reach your goals?",reflection,2
"And, I guess that there will be manuals and stuff like that on-",other,3
"So, you're not too happy to be here. This is the last thing that you want to be doing this afternoon.",reflection,2
"Okay, how does that sound like a first step goal for you?",therapist_input,1
Not yet?,question,0
"Mm-hmm. So, as long as it has to do with cars, you'd be sweet with that?",reflection,2
"Okay. And I'm wondering if that concern is coming from, ""It's been okay. I've got these messages from friends.""",reflection,2
"Okay. I-I also noticed that, uh, it's been about three months or so since you picked up the prescription for her chronic inhaler.",therapist_input,1
What else besides drinking helps you relax and unwind in the evenings?,question,0
Yeah. And your-- part of your wife used to do a lot of that for you?,reflection,2
"Right. So, right now, it really is important to you to put the family values first? And religion is still very important to you, but you feel like maybe you're losing faith a little bit?",reflection,2
"Well, you might not be drinking that much, and other kids are also trying alcohol. I'd like to share with you the risk of using. Alcohol and drugs could really harm you because your brain is still changing. It also-- you're very high risk for becoming addicted. Alcohol and drugs could also interfere with your role in life and your goals, especially in sports, and it could cause unintended sex. How do you feel about this information?",therapist_input,1
"-all the time. But one of the things I'm noticing, we've been going here for a wee while now talking and, uh, I haven't noticed any lack of attention.",therapist_input,1
Amount of four.,reflection,2
"Mm-hmm. Five, six drinks, like?",question,0
So what would you do to make sure you didn't get hungry at work?,question,0
"Actually, you would be amazed how many people do it.",therapist_input,1
-the effect? Okay.,therapist_input,1
"Yeah, with while going in, I think you got a high steep.",reflection,2
"All right. So, quite a few symptoms there-",reflection,2
"Um, because I know you mentioned you tried the Chantix. Um, what have you tried? Uh, Zyban or Wellbutrin?",question,0
"I'm here to help, okay?",other,3
"Yeah. And that must've been really brave for you to do something that seems really daunting at first, yet you were really successful at it.",other,3
Guts? Yeah?,other,3
"Okay. So, you're gonna try to reduce the drinking, not sure about the smoking, what the plan is but I think we did agree upon earlier that you would move it outside, at least while he's sick?",question,0
"-to-to make it a little smoother. Okay. So, kind of thinking along those lines, how important is it to you make some changes or make some adjustments to your drinking to sort of fit with your values and your goals for yourself?",question,0
"Okay. So, you've got a lot of concerns about what's happened to- up until this point, as far as your drinking. What do you know about, um, drinking alcohol throughout pregnancy?",question,0
Like you've done anything helpful.,reflection,2
Exactly. And what's happening in Type II diabetes is your-your fat cells and liver cells and muscle cells are resistant to insulin. It's almost like they're saying we can't use that.,therapist_input,1
"Tomorrow. Okay, great. So who would be able to help you get to bed on time and make sure you're up on time by 6:15?",question,0
"That's why it's helpful to look at this and give some perspective. On a scale of 1-10, what is your readiness to change, 1 being I don't want to change at all, and 10 is I really want to change?",question,0
"Right, right.",other,3
"Um, so that's one-one thing, and the other is, um, I do see fair amount of chipped teeth-",therapist_input,1
"Yeah. So, there's something here about your level of-- about how confident you are around writing or how unconfident you are, that sounds like it's getting in the way.",reflection,2
"-coffee, tea. Yeah, you've heard this before, I'm sure.",other,3
"Okay. So, okay. So it sounds like you had a lot of thoughts going through your head. Um, you said that you're worried that everyone's looking at you. What other thoughts were there that were in your mind?",reflection,2
"You did really well talking with me today, and I thank you so much for just sharing your heart.",other,3
"Okay, wow. So there's a lot happening right now, Sal. Anything else that that's concerning you?",question,0
"Okay. And I'm wondering as far as, um, bringing the baby into the world and, you know, your future as a parent, ho-how important is it to have a healthy baby to you?",question,0
What was-- what was your partner's name?,question,0
"Uh, you seem fairly committed to taking the medicine to reduce your risk so that you can enjoy your retirement.",reflection,2
The drug may have had an effect on that?,question,0
Sometimes you forget where you're at.,reflection,2
"Yeah. How would it be for your mum, do you think, if you were to tell her that this is something that you're-- is really important for you and that you know that this time you really need to do this for her and for the family? What-what might that be like for her to hear?",question,0
"12 years. Okay. So she's stood by you then for the time, [crosstalk] but this time she said, it happens again I'm out of here?",reflection,2
"Thank you for coming in to see me today, Nina. I'm looking forward to getting to know you a little bit and hearing a little bit about you and what brought you in here today.",other,3
"Um, what do you think would make it easier for you to cut down or quit using Methamphetamine?",question,0
[unintelligible 00:04:45]?,other,3
- story right?,reflection,2
"I really want to thank you for, you know, exploring this with me today, and I'm wondering if we can kind of continue this conversation again, and talk about those steps, and how it goes with talking to your partner about giving up drinking and, um, the- giving you a chance to do some more research and, you know, maybe looking through these brochures and kind of just coming back and sharing a little bit more about, you know, what you thought about the information and what feels right for you. Is that something you'd be open to?",therapist_input,1
I think where we start is where you feel comfortable starting.,other,3
So I know that you're kind of 25% interested-,reflection,2
"So, I'm wondering, have you noticed any problems from your drinking?",question,0
"Yeah. So, you're not feeling comfortable with the way that, you said, your clothes fit.",reflection,2
"It hurts? Oh, I'm sorry to hear that. Where are you having pain?",question,0
"Okay, I see. You wanna be a different sort of dad-",reflection,2
"So you've rung your mom, had a chat to her.",other,3
"Right, and you-- so you're busy enough, and—",reflection,2
Okay.,other,3
"It does, uh, it does a lot of positive things for you.",reflection,2
"Oh, it was all-all that they could see that-that was-",reflection,2
It has a lot of alcohol in it.,other,3
"So, you're really are trying to be safe and-and make sure that-",reflection,2
"Well, the good news is in terms of the nicotinic stomatitis, at the point in which you stop smoking, you can actually reverse all the negative effects that occurred and you might also know that you can stop the progression of any other diseases that had started, just by quitting smoking.",therapist_input,1
"Okay. So it's, um, so it's good, because you're not drinking and driving, but you're still really drinking a lot. Um, and yeah. Okay. So, let's-let's talk a little bit about that, how you might be able to make some changes. Because I think you really need to- need to stop drinking like this.",other,3
"Well, that, you know, now that's a-a really different way of looking at it than how you were looking at what you can do versus what's getting in your way that you know you can't do.",reflection,2
Is that right?,question,0
"Okay, yeah, I know that, yeah, yeah. Okay, so. So, um, so are you sure you wanna try to start out with the- that initial [unintelligible 00:08:07]",reflection,2
"Yeah, yeah, yeah. Well, it's not that easy to get started. You do certainly have to have some motivation to want to do it. Um, and when you first start, oftentimes you do feel a little wobbly or a little insecure.",therapist_input,1
So you know actually which kids-,question,0
"Mm-hmm, okay. So in five years' time, it's fast forward to the future. Five years time, how would you like it to be?",question,0
"I saw that your doctor made the referral and, um, and I really appreciate you taking the time to come and make that appointment.",therapist_input,1
"Well, you're here. And-and-and I have you give, uh-uh, credit for that. It took a lot to come in today and, um, when, um- when somebody is actually talking safety for themselves, which I-I hear you saying, um, calling a taxi or-or staying home.",other,3
That shocked me when I found that out.,therapist_input,1
"Okay, great. I look forward to talking next time.",other,3
"Um, what would- what would make you decide, ""This is something that's not right for me?""",question,0
Why not?,reflection,2
"Oh, it looks like he called in cholesterol statin. Do you know how you're supposed to take this medication?",question,0
And for him this 12-- You wondered that the 12-step stuff working for him.,reflection,2
"You-- Sounds like you did that, and that allowed you to really focus on the time [unintelligible 00:00:57] delaying your cigarettes. So-so that's gone well. So, what are the things that are not going as well as you'd liked?",therapist_input,1
And the coffee helps a little bit because it perks you up?,reflection,2
"-of course, that's harder if you're not the one planning. So, some of the things that can be useful if you're at a party say, um, and there's already alcohol there, and there are other kids that maybe aren't your closest friends, um, some of the things that I would recommend since you're interested are, you know, carrying around a different drink that looks like it has alcohol in it. So, you know, even carrying an empty beer bottle or beer can or, you know, if people are having a mixed drink, just having the coke, say-",therapist_input,1
"Hi, Mr. Stowe.",other,3
"Oh, thank you, Ruth. Thank you for coming today.",other,3
Okay. So that's just what you've always done.,reflection,2
"Oh, so it's your first?",question,0
"Mmh, and when we might be talking about something that doesn't interest you, what would I notice?",question,0
"All right, Catherine, welcome back. I'll be interested to, sort of, after we met last time, what-what were you-- what have you been thinking about over the week 'cause, you know, I-I remembered last time I asked you what you were thinking about coming, but-",question,0
"Uh-huh, and tell me how your physical therapy is going?",question,0
"Okay. Yeah, it sounds kinda similar to your, um, your value of respect to yourself.",reflection,2
"What I would recommend is that you avoid over-the-counter cold remedies, keep him away from any friends or family who may have the flu, keep him well hydrated, um, avoid excessive dust, and avoid smoking. And at least that last one's easy because you are an ex-smoker now.",therapist_input,1
"But I guess what I'm really interested in is-is you've made a commitment 22 days, drug-free. Haven't gone back into that lifestyle. What-what's keeping you, 'cause you're at the crossroads, you kind of just pause there at the moment. I'm not sure about this other bit over here. What keeping you in that place?",question,0
-those oral piercings can do to your teeth?,question,0
She'd tell you off.,reflection,2
"So, having more reliable childcare could make a big difference.",reflection,2
"Okay. And so you mentioned the- you know, quite a few reasons why you would like to cut down. Um, have you thought at all about how you might go about doing that?",question,0
"So, um, what kinda- what-what are you starting? What's this business? If you-you don't have to tell me if you don't want, I know it's on the up and up, but you don't have to tell me if you don't want.",question,0
Tell me about those things you're noticing that you hadn't noticed before.,question,0
"So sometimes-- almost sounds like, um, your feedback would be, uh, useful to you. Like some immediate feedback in terms of like, um, like [inaudible 00:05:53]",reflection,2
"Well, how about hypothetically if I were to ask you, how would your drinking have to impact your life in order for you to be ready to change your drinking?",question,0
At home or you think that they'll be supportive but they're not giving- they're not giving you what you need?,reflection,2
What do you think it would take?,question,0
"I, uh, I'm a case manager with your health plan. I understand that you came in today to talk about your diabetes.",therapist_input,1
For driving.,therapist_input,1
"Okay. And can I ask you, Barbara, how-how is all of this affecting you day-to-day? How's-how's it affecting your life?",question,0
Only snort it?,question,0
"Well, I sure-sure would, um, tell the-the people who-who need to know-",therapist_input,1
How about then your-your kind of hunch about that?,question,0
"Got to check out, why not?",reflection,2
"Definitely, can lower your cholesterol to 50%.",other,3
"So then, since you've been on your own since you've separated, divorced and you've noticed that the things you eat and how you eat has changed.",reflection,2
"Maybe we can kind of put that on the shelf for a moment, and we'll come back to it and sort of look at, you know, what is- what does the guidelines have to say about why. And, um, and-and I'm wondering if we can kind of just have a look for a moment at, um, your pregnancy, and is this something that you were- you were hoping to have a baby?",question,0
"Yeah, I'm all about trying to help you figure out what types of physical activity bring you the most joy because those are the things that you'll make time for.",other,3
"Are you ever, um, places where there are parents around or-",question,0
"Okay. So, it sounds like you have some reasons to cut back on drinking and you have ways to relax besides drinking and it sounds like you're pretty ready to cut back.",therapist_input,1
"Oh, I'm sorry. But, you know, if you have just got a sore throat, then there's not much I can do about that. It's just, you know, something that we all get from time to time. Perhaps, what you really need to do is, uh, you know, just take some paracetamol and get some fluids.",therapist_input,1
"Uh, no. I think that you clearly have pain, and clearly you have lots of physical symptoms, and they're clearly getting in the way of-",other,3
-really watch-,therapist_input,1
"And it sounds like sometimes when you're in there with your mates and had a few drinks, it's hard to hold on to that vision of the future.",reflection,2
"Oh, wow.",other,3
"Um, so, that it was sort of after that that the girlfriend-- Your girlfriend, I don't know, well, her name. Um, your girlfriend decided-- The mailbox and she's--",reflection,2
-about stuff that's-that's quite deep-,reflection,2
"Yeah they look pretty good on the plate, don't they?",reflection,2
Great. I'd be interested to see how well you do on your goal in the next few weeks. Would you be willing to come back and talk to me about it?,question,0
"Okay. Well, you know I will be back later. If any questions would arise, we can always talk about that then. Um, otherwise, again, I will have to write a violation, and, um, if you have any questions or need anything from me, please let me know. Um, otherwise, again, I'll be back later today.",therapist_input,1
"Not too much, just some stuff that might just give you a little bit of background information on-",therapist_input,1
"-wasn't that-- Is that right? Yeah? So, ""Do I live a party lifestyle-- party-girl kind of lifestyle, or am I got some other dreams to follow?"" So, they're hard calls to make. And-and it all-- And there are no three ways. We will have to make those calls at some point.",reflection,2
Okay. Does that sound like a goal you want to work on now or?,question,0
"Uh, well, obviously that's a non-NHS thing so we have to charge you for that and our going rate for that is, uh, £12.",therapist_input,1
"Oh, so you've been here a while?",question,0
That was something that you'd been planning?,question,0
Wow. You really are involved in music.,reflection,2
"Yeah, yeah. Thinking about your friends, you know, how would you soft of think about your friends 'cause, you know, I guess you go out with your girlfriends and stuff.",question,0
"Okay. So, the-the absolute most-",reflection,2
"Okay, so money.",reflection,2
"So, if you did decide to get exercising more into your daily routine, how would you go about doing it?",question,0
"-in those situations? That's great. You know, it's-it's tough to do sometimes, and I really commend you for being able to-to stick with that.",reflection,2
"-you know, good to know about and-and-and maybe in-- within those options or something you might say, ""Oh yeah, I'd give that a go. Have a look.""",therapist_input,1
Is someone who actually who has some pretty clear ideas about where she wants you as a couple to go-,reflection,2
And then-,other,3
"Okay, will you be interested in hearing about those recommendations?",question,0
"You're absolutely right, but keep in mind that the food pyramid is to be used as a guideline only. When it comes to nutrition, we have to have a more personalized approach. So I have a hunch, and that is the excess fruit that you were consuming probably caused your weight rebound. What's your impression?",therapist_input,1
"Okay, so, um, that's great 'cause it pretty much covers all the stuff that I think I needed to go over with you. Um, let's see. I guess we didn't talk about what would happen if your parents found out you were drinking.",other,3
"Okay. So, you've been able to kind of avoid any kind of consequences, and right now, you're not feeling that talking about birth control is something on your-your list.",reflection,2
"Okay, okay. I just wanted to let you know, I'm a little bit concerned about your level of drinking. We know that excessive drinking can make problems worse or can actually cause health problems at times, and I was just wondering if you thought about the connection between your drinking and things like the anxiety and the insomnia that you came in with today?",therapist_input,1
"That's a good way to be, right?",reflection,2
"So, it would be up to them?",question,0
"-rollover, the domino effect starts to happen, and they start looking at other aspects.",reflection,2
Uh-huh. So kind of combining you alls-,reflection,2
"Let's just come back to another thing, uh, that we were talking about a little bit earlier, and it's around your meth use as well and-and-and with your gay friends, with gay lifestyle. And-and that sounds like you're saying that-that-that when you party, when you go into the clubs, when you're being with friends that the meth use is always there?",question,0
"Oh, nice.",other,3
"-with me, and also before I do the exam, you know, I'm always on your case about flossing, so maybe we can take [inaudible 00:02:46]-",other,3
So you're consciously trying to cut back.,reflection,2
"Alcohol can have some dangerous effects on your body. So along with contributing to high blood pressure, it can have a big impact on your liver, which you need to keep in mind. So your liver has several different roles in your body. First, it helps process excess fatty acids before they get distributed to the rest of your body. It also helps process alcohol and other drugs. So when you have an excess of alcohol, your liver can't work as efficiently and the fatty acids build up, and over time, your liver won't be able to work as well.",therapist_input,1
"Yeah. So, we've run out of time but I also want to ask you a final question, where to from here, what's next?",question,0
"Okay. You're noticing there- there are too many great benefits to being physically active and, um, today you've mentioned energy, mood, strength and body confidence.",reflection,2
Mm-hm.,other,3
So a little bit sort of energy is not quite there sometimes? The vitality.,reflection,2
So a few drinks is nothing new to you?,question,0
And you found us okay?,question,0
"Okay. Um, what is it that you wanna get out of being here?",question,0
"- some prescribed, some-",reflection,2
"- in this new approach, I'd be seeing you regularly. We can keep an eye on your symptoms, and if they change, then we can investigate as appropriate. But if they stay the same, then, you know, we can be-",therapist_input,1
"So, basically, we're here, I'm just gonna talk to you for a little bit about sort of what your goals are for your life, um, get to know you a little bit better and talk about some different behaviors that you might be engaging in. It's not my job at all to judge you or to try and change you, you know. Basically, I'm gonna talk to you about how things are going, any changes you might want to make in your life, how I could help you with that, and just what I can do that's going to be most beneficial for you.",therapist_input,1
So is that different from when you've come in here before?,question,0
"-the people who drink a lot, um, since you have some other friends. Um, yeah. So, do you have any questions for me or?",question,0
"Nearly 13 years, so and-and so-so she stuck with you, and I'm pick up that's important to you, um, and-and-and yet you talk about it, it just seems easy, this bit over here, this whole lifestyle.",reflection,2
"Mm-hmm. Okay. Hmm. So, I mean, I guess what we need to do then is kinda talk about some goals for how to be-",other,3
So nothing you want to talk about right now?,reflection,2
-birth control issue and this importance comes down as your reason why you're not down here.,reflection,2
"-which is fantastic. So, the next step is to really deal with the dog, deal with the pet. I know it's- so- It's gonna be hard to do that. But there are always people who will adopt animals. I'm sure that you have friends or family members.",therapist_input,1
There's a couple of people.,other,3
"Well, welcome, Ricky.",other,3
"Okay, hard part's over. So the good news is no cavities.",therapist_input,1
"Grand. You talked a little bit about, uh, you'd really like to get back with Kristie?",question,0
"So, um, how serious do you think this issue is to sort?",question,0
Okay. What some people your age do is try stopping drinking for a period of time just to see what that feels like.,therapist_input,1
"You don't wanna lose your support group, yeah. You just wanna them to support you in being healthy, while helping them, raising the babe, and so we're just taking path B. You don't wanna lose them, just maybe the lifestyle it sounds like.",other,3
"Hm. What we also find is that people make these little changes, small changes, and that starts to kind of well, it makes them-",therapist_input,1
Security.,reflection,2
"Yeah. Surprised, ain't you?",reflection,2
-just a touch.,reflection,2
"Well, there's-there's a reason that [crosstalk] people are concerned.",other,3
So that's something that you can work with your case manager on.,therapist_input,1
Mm-hmm. So it's kind of surprising to you that something you've been doing and you've been doing more and more of it is actually pretty bad for you.,reflection,2
"Yeah. Well, and your daughter.",reflection,2
"Hi, John. Nice to see you again. So, tell me, how are things going?",question,0
Fantastic. Thank you.,other,3
So you were in a lot of pain?,question,0
"Um, yeah. And-and, w-what were the drinks, were?",question,0
Great.,other,3
"Yeah. And your thought was, yeah, right, I hear that, but actually, I don't want to make all these big changes in my life.",reflection,2
"Okay, okay. Good. Um, I think you've got a good plan there. Um, what would you say to us getting back together, say, in two weeks, just for us to kind of revisit and see what kind of progress you've made, you know, if you've got something worked out, great, but if you've hit a bump in the road, I tell you what, we'll put our heads together. We'll come up with another plan.",question,0
"Thanks. Just so you know, when I talk to patients about drug use, my job is to be helpful. I'm not going to tell you what to do or what you should do. What I can do is share some information and be a resource. Does that make sense?",therapist_input,1
"-the-the piercing might not last forever, but your teeth really are-",reflection,2
"Okay. So what I'm hearing you say is that, if you could just reduce the amount of time that you're needing your mom, she might be more supportive, more onboard?",reflection,2
Okay. Does that concern you at all?,question,0
I would like to share with you these materials to show the risk of drinking at younger age. I also wanted to encourage you to think about these risks. What do you think about that?,question,0
Right.,other,3
"Right. So you feel as though actually, enough hasn't been done in the way of-of tests?",reflection,2
"Yeah. So, have, uh-- So then, you started drinking again, and that was-- If you could just kind of give me a little timeframe of how long ago that was, that-that six months of complete--",question,0
Yeah. And it sounds like maybe like-,reflection,2
-I get a sense.,other,3
"So, it seems like it would be really difficult to change because it's something that's really important to you right now.",reflection,2
It's a nice sort of form of stress relief.,reflection,2
Can't prevent all of it-,therapist_input,1
"So your asthma has been acting up and there's a lot of stuff, not just the asthma going on?",reflection,2
And it doesn't feel good?,reflection,2
Mm-hmm. Wh-what don't you like about her?,question,0
-to do these things that you want to do-,reflection,2
"Well, now's the time to quit. It's really gotten to the point where you can't keep smoking. Not only for him, like I said, but also for you. You're putting yourself at risk for lung cancer, for emphysema, for oral cancers, for heart disease, for all kinds of things-",other,3
-or particularly on-on meth use?,question,0
"Right, so he kinda gave you a directive?",reflection,2
"Okay, so, um, there would be, so what you're, what you're attempting to do is, um, well-- Tell me, I guess, uh, tell me a little bit more about it so I understand it a little bit more.",reflection,2
"Okay, okay. So, there's a shift from last time?",question,0
"Yeah. So, in terms of being supportive and a sort of support you're gonna need to make these changes.",therapist_input,1
You've heard of it?,question,0
"Yeah, you're feeling a little bit dissatisfied with your health patterns?",reflection,2
Great. What could maybe get in the way of you not getting up by 6:15?,question,0
It is becoming a pain in the butt,reflection,2
"Okay, so you're feeling some low energy and you know, in the past, when you've been more active and eating differently, you've had more energy?",reflection,2
"Okay. You know what? I-it seems like things have been really a struggle for you lately, and I have noticed that you haven't been in the best mood, so I'm really- I am concerned about you, but again, it's your choice if that's something that you feel like you want to share with me.",reflection,2
"It doesn't feel like a problem to you right now, yeah.",reflection,2
"Mm-hmm. Yeah, you used to have contact with your mom, you know, almost every other night and now for just about a week, you haven't even gotten to talk to her. I can imagine that being pretty difficult. I remember you saying something about like your dad's birthday coming up?",reflection,2
All right. So it's kind of silly stuff that's getting you into trouble.,reflection,2
Okay. And how much do they typically drink?,question,0
"Mm-hmm. So, um, so I think we should set a goal that you're gonna stop drinking.",therapist_input,1
"But over the years, you've actually reduced your smoking or you've stopped altogether or at times?",reflection,2
But you've been drunk before?,question,0
"All right, take care, bye.",other,3
Tell me about how your parents raised you?,question,0
"-at the moment, is what I'm picking up.",reflection,2
Things could be better?,reflection,2
"Um, as well as maybe doing some sort of certificate or getting some classes and training in computers?",question,0
What makes it uncomfortable?,question,0
Like your arm?,other,3
Okay. And what do you like to do for fun?,question,0
"Have you put on a kind of real hat, you know, you get a real hat here, you know? What-what's your hunch about that? Is it a kind of-- that kind of realization it's a bit of a smoke screen, what's your hunch?",question,0
"Yeah. Um, you're- you're- you're aware of the- of the links between your health and your weight, and you are concerned, to some extent, about that, and ideally it sounds like you'd like to do something about it, it's just that your life is busy and rushed, and you tend to use convenience foods in order to get the work done.",reflection,2
"Oh yeah, right. The family has been so much coming first that you have sort of taken a back seat?",reflection,2
"You've been managing in the best way you can. You also have some doubts about it too, it sounds like?",reflection,2
"Yeah, what does she do?",question,0
"Um, what-- are there any other problems? Any other things that-that are a bit of a downside to this?",question,0
"Hi, Deborah. How are you doing today?",question,0
"Okay. Behavior like this could get you suspended, doesn't that concern you?",therapist_input,1
"Mm-hmm. So when you say mostly, it kind of leaves a little bit of room for there to be some trouble.",reflection,2
MIT.,reflection,2
"Oh, okay.",other,3
"Oh, cool. What are your plans for after high school?",question,0
"Um, and some of these things are kind of related to each other I think we're already seeing.",reflection,2
Tell me a little bit about what happened with the-the Chantix.,question,0
Okay. And it sounds like you're listening to that black and white line.,reflection,2
I think it is.,other,3
You know maybe they'll walk that road with you too.,other,3
"If I gave you a scale from 0 to 10, 0 being not ready at all to cut back on drinking and 10 being very ready, what number would you be at?",question,0
"Okay. So over the past year, the smoking has increased. And that's been mainly in the evening?",question,0
"It comes along to me and talk today a bit about how you felt about that. Initially, it can be quite a bit of a-bit of a shock. It didn't quite fit with how you saw things.",reflection,2
"Okay. So, like I said, I'll plan to meet with you again in a couple weeks.",other,3
"So-so let me ask you this, given everything going on in your life right now on a scale of 1 to 10, where 10 is the most important thing to do, and 1 would be the least important thing to do, how important is it for you to quit smoking?",question,0
"Brothers and sisters, that, uh, would also be very supportive if you were to make this journey?",question,0
Okay. I appreciate. We've- we've probably used up the time that we have. I would love to see you next week if you'd be willing to schedule another appointment and talk with you more about this. Is that something that would be helpful?,therapist_input,1
There's nothing yet.,reflection,2
"So there are a lot of different directions that we could take. Um, you've mentioned wanting to make changes in your physical activity. You've mentioned wanting to make changes in your eating habits and also just wanting more body confidence. Um, what- what's on your mind is as far as a- as a change topic for the rest of our session today?",reflection,2
"And the social stigma, because you don't want your daughter to think of you like that, whatever that- that as a smoker, you know. You know there're people who make the assumption and it- it sounds like those are more important to you than the medical things, and who cares why it's important?",reflection,2
Okay. And what's it like for you?,question,0
You said five cigarettes this time.,therapist_input,1
Okay. And do you know where you're going to apply to college?,question,0
I can- I can hear that you are really eager to just get it finished-,reflection,2
"And now thinking about, looking after your health and wanting to be healthy for your wife and your baby.",reflection,2
"-and what the safe limits are for women is 10 drinks for women a week with about two drinks, uh, per day.",therapist_input,1
Yeah? What sort of dad do you reckon you'd be?,question,0
"Oh what-- So, what does serious look like? Um--",question,0
"So, Rick, just in regards to your flatmate situation at the moment with Tristan. Uh, you know, we talked about how walking through this program and with the support of your parents and having some positive influence to help you through this. I just want to rethink a bit if you stay living with Tristan. What are the sort of pros and cons of that? What are the good things about living there, what are the not-so-good things about living there?",question,0
Got it.,other,3
Can you tell me more?,question,0
"Um, I guess, you know, as your dentist, I have- I have a couple of concerns about lip piercings, oral piercings. I wonder what have you heard about how having an oral piercing can affect your-your teeth or your gums?",question,0
Mm-hmm. So you'd drink maybe just a couple of times a week and maybe a little bit less on each occasion? Is that what you're saying?,reflection,2
"Um, you've tried a lot of tablets. Some prescribed, some herbal remedies-",reflection,2
"Yeah, this information has opened your eyes in some ways and as you talked to your roommate about it, she was even shocked to know that you were drinking as much as you- as you realized when you did the questionnaire.",reflection,2
"Uh, welcome. And, uh—",other,3
"Oh no, the smoking's going to cause you more problems than the-- than anything else. I can promise you that, David.",therapist_input,1
- depending on what your stomach's doing?,question,0
Great. And you've noticed a mood enhancement effect of exercise.,reflection,2
"Well, we have that here, but again, the-the idea would be for you to actually quit smoking.",therapist_input,1
"Yes, always happy to hear that. I do have some concerns though because I'm seeing some irritation in your mouth in the palate that's called nicotinic stomatitis and-",other,3
"-you know, nurturing that baby is really important to you-",reflection,2
"Yeah. How-how would you wanna be supported, Billy?",question,0
And who are these people?,question,0
Uh-huh. Yeah.,other,3
Did you ask them?,question,0
- quite a lot because of these symptoms.,reflection,2
"Got it. Okay. Um, all right. Well, you mentioned a couple of times that you've made a few decisions to try and limit the dangerous aspect of the drinking. Why did you make those decisions?",question,0
What other questions do you have for me about community service?,other,3
"Well, to be honest with you, you mentioned the patch. I can't recommend a patch to you if you're gonna continue smoking. That can actually be pretty dangerous for you. In order to advise you about this at all, I need you to tell me a little bit more about your smoking history and how much you're smoking now.",therapist_input,1
"So, um-- And-and maybe it's about small steps and first steps.",therapist_input,1
"Yep, yep. Could that mean that some of your friends are probably moving around some similar sort of stuff like you, wondering about where they're going and-",question,0
"- and- and what activities you might end up, um, choosing.",other,3
"Mm-hmm. So, what changes have you made, Billy?",question,0
Okay and how did it end?,question,0
You're concerned that they're gonna kind of treat you like a child.,reflection,2
"Yeah. So, so if-if your doctor says it's okay with the Wellbutrin, one-- uh, we see very little if any weight gain-",therapist_input,1
"Okay, gotcha. So, you know, that it needs to get done-",reflection,2
Right. That's interesting.,other,3
"And it wasn't essentially easy for you to make the time to come down, and you had to wait in the waiting room, and now I raised the subject of weight just when you're thinking of going.",reflection,2
"Okay. Okay, so that sounds-- I think that's great. So why would you be up at a six and not down at a two level? What kinds of thing would push you to be there?",question,0
And now you've got—,other,3
"-and, uh, and-and also might help you organize and connect up with other services that might be out there or do things, um, like that. I don't know. What it- how does that sound to you?",therapist_input,1
"Were you aware of the fact that smoking these little cigarillos, the Swisher Sweets, can have some of the same negative health effects?",other,3
"-very normal. Absolutely. It's an absolutely normal thing to feel that, and especially when you've suffered something that you have and suffered to it, the stroke and the trying to get rehabbed and trying to find a way to get back home and going through the wobblies, this is perfectly normal.",therapist_input,1
"So, you're drinking, perhaps, two drinks a day. Um, and I'm wondering, what have you heard about the recommendations for drinking levels?",question,0
"So it sounds like it's a way to relax. It's a way to socialize with your friends from work, and it's hard to imagine what it would be like for you at work if you couldn't go outside and smoke.",reflection,2
"So it's been a bit of a-a bit of a shock, but now you kinda reflect on it.",reflection,2
"Oh, that I'm not sure of. Um, can I get back to you later on this afternoon with that answer?",question,0
So you know yourself best and you wanna be sort of the boss of your body and you don't want somebody else telling you what- what's okay and what's not okay. And it seems like you're not maybe too concerned right now about your substance use.,reflection,2
So that's really encouraging you thinking about how good you'll feel afterwards once it's done and taken.,other,3
Mm. So the idea of counseling in your family is for crazy people only and it's looked down upon and the cost would cause a problem too?,reflection,2
Right. So you notice it's a bit worse when your husband's not around? Okay.,reflection,2
I'll do some checking around for you. I will. Yeah.,reflection,2
"Good. So, we'll see you in a week.",other,3
"All right. Well, yeah. So the issue again is I can't be hearing reports about you drinking. I can't be hearing that you're at parties and you can't be seeing pictures on Facebook. You know, there-there are rules at this school and in my job, I have to enforce them. So, you know, like I said, I get it, you know-",therapist_input,1
"Oh, good, and so feeling under pressure here.",reflection,2
Tell me about how you've been feeling?,question,0
"So do you- do you, um, put out there about the felony conviction before you even go for the interview?",therapist_input,1
"Well, I'm wondering, like-- it sounds like it's a thing that you're putting up as saying you can't do-",reflection,2
"So now almost like that's not good enough, like now you have to, now it's the dog and now-",reflection,2
It wasn't like that for sure 30 years ago.,reflection,2
And why did you say five or six rather than like two or three?,question,0
-like these guys have been around for you-,reflection,2
"Yes, it is.",other,3
"Yeah. Yeah. So, how would I know if we were talking and you were blocking off? What would I notice, uh, in our session together?",question,0
-getting a qualification?,question,0
"So, and then you mentioned quite a few things about medical problems. So, um, you mentioned, um, asthma, um, acute bronchitis did you say—",reflection,2
"That's the worst, the silent treatment.",reflection,2
"Great. And then, um, tell me a little bit about your family?",question,0
"Hi, Billy, how are you doing? It's good to see you again.",question,0
You were noticing that it's having an impact on your breathing and health wasn't so good.,reflection,2
Uh-huh. Anything else?,question,0
Okay. Why don't we start by just having you tell me a little bit about yourself?,question,0
"So more negative things about your drinking, like getting into trouble with your mom and missing a class at school when you had a hangover?",question,0
Uh-uh.,other,3
That's very good.,other,3
-for her asthma. I noticed that she's been in the emergency room five times in the last year for her asthma. What's that- what's that been like for you?,question,0
Hmm.,other,3
"Uh-- You're welcome. And- so what about, um, I know I had a client that told me a couple of things. He was doing some work on this, uh, if you- if you'd be interested I could tell you what he shared with me.",therapist_input,1
"Yeah, yeah. Something we can- we can do over the next while is-is really get some very concrete things in place to support you to do that.",therapist_input,1
"So, for you, it's your, you know, it sounds like you really want to be prepared.",reflection,2
What are some downsides to smoking pot?,question,0
And you're instant friends.,reflection,2
What would be some ways you could go about being able to get your freedom back?,question,0
"So, she needed to eat every three hours last night and that was really frustrating for you?",reflection,2
Yeah. So what-what-what about your criminal record is blocking you from getting where you wanna be?,question,0
It's fine.,other,3
It-it is individual.,reflection,2
"Yeah, okay, and Fiona's been pretty staunch.",reflection,2
"Yes. Yeah, yeah. So I think that- I think, I'm just a really big advocate of w-whatever is gonna enhance the quality and the length of your life. And if somebody becomes addicted to nicotine go- gum, God bless them. They're still gonna live longer, you know what I mean?",therapist_input,1
And it sounds as though you're not doing lots of the things that you used to do. That you-,reflection,2
"Yeah. So, mm, we need to think about what's the very first step.",therapist_input,1
So that positive self-talk could really go a long way for you?,question,0
"So, I guess I'm wondering if you've given any thought to other ways in which you could cope with stress without relying on the drinking so much.",question,0
"Mm. What do you think she might want for you, like upon her for your children?",question,0
And it's kind of scary.,reflection,2
What part of the [unintelligible 00:01:22] are you from?,question,0
"'Cause you have to understand the odds are about-- sort of-of tend to be about 25% on the 100, that-that's [crosstalk]",therapist_input,1
Tell me something about that.,question,0
But for obvious times.,other,3
You're very welcome.,other,3
What do you think you need to do in order to be able to achieve that goal of getting home?,question,0
"What do you mean, maybe? I just told you how bad it is for you. It's messing up your mouth, you're putting yourself at risk for all these other diseases. This is really important. You need to quit.",therapist_input,1
"Now, you don't wanna let that go on for months at a time, that's when it can become serious.",therapist_input,1
-because you feel that she might find out something about you that you're not quite sure you want her to find out?,question,0
"Yeah, so, there, I mean, a lot of the other dangers of drinking, like, um, not just car accidents, but you can have other accidents, you know, people, um, you know, will fall or, um, you know, break things or a lot of people actually end up breaking their bones and ending up in the emergency room because they've been drunk and falling down or, you know, as a girl, it's really important too that you're careful because you could be sexually assaulted.",therapist_input,1
"Yeah. You know, like-- I-- And, some people wouldn't even, sort of, get in the door or wouldn't be as open as you've been today, okay, to an extent, so, you know, like I said, good on you, yeah. You know, being able to-- It's hard to come to a place like this and start to really open up, so, you know, you've just shown that you can do that. Yeah.",reflection,2
No?,question,0
"Mm. So, something dramatic happened?",reflection,2
"-for you? So, I'm wondering about, um, whether good mates lead you into trouble, if it's something you wanna do. If you got something different that you wanna do, what would a good mate do in that situation?",question,0
"-when you think about what he-he-- Yeah, he's stereotypical.",reflection,2
Not part of on the wire?,reflection,2
Okay. Good.,other,3
"Thanks for coming in today. I guess you've, uh, sat in that seat with lots of people like me in the past.",question,0
"Mm. So some of your feelings, uh, of being overwhelmed or about the logistics of the appointment, and some of it is you just don't like medical appointments and medical people?",reflection,2
So you avoided looking at people. It sounds like you wore black as well in kind of preparation anyway.,reflection,2
Okay. So that gives you a good reason not to drink. Okay. Anything else?,question,0
"You're not sure. So you have a lot of on your mind right now. You just opened up to me. You told me that you've been cutting, that you've also been thinking about hurting yourself, killing yourself, not being here. Short-term, the cutting is helping you. You feel like a burden to mom, that stresses you out. That makes you sad. You see how much she struggles, but also on the same hand, we see how much you've been trying and how much you've been trying to help out by trying to go to school. We know your attendance is good. You go most of the time, you know, you're trying to keep up your grades.You have a C average, even having A in math, which we know was the lowest grade you had all semester. So all of those things shows how much effort you've put in and we see that effort. So you've been doing what you can and it's normal to feel like sometimes it's not enough. But that's-that's what we're here for so that you can tell us those things and we can help you.",reflection,2
"Yes. I was going to say the other thing that I would say- that I would consider because the senior center, and I know you were really active in the senior center before-",therapist_input,1
Okay. So where would you be do you think?,question,0
Yeah. So how often do you end up with no money in your pocket? Can be the times when you end up with money in your pocket,question,0
Good. Are you okay today?,question,0
"Yeah. Okay. Well, I really appreciate you being willing to even talk about it. And I get that right now, this is not something that you wanna pursue. Would it be okay if I brought it up in our next visit? 'Cause I-I know that you've said you don't want a lecture, but on the other hand, I am- I am concerned.",therapist_input,1
Great. So how will you know that you-your plan is working?,question,0
"What's there to think about? [chuckles] You said it's not that something you do all that often, and there's all these negative side effects, there's all these risks that you're putting yourself in.",therapist_input,1
"-[unintelligible 00:13:12] people. So okay, anything else? No? Okay. All right.",question,0
And you- you've continued to work really hard with both the physical therapy and the Tai Chi and taking care of your house and doing all those things.,reflection,2
"Yeah, yeah.",other,3
What a great plan and you said you're going to start tomorrow.,reflection,2
-they're probably not a good influence.,reflection,2
Cute. What kind of dog?,question,0
Marijuana affects how well you play. What would be the other benefits for you?,question,0
"So, it's, you know, thinking as quickly and responding as quickly and-and things like that-- [crosstalk]",reflection,2
It's kind of cool?,question,0
"So, you'd have them in and, um, I'm just curious about the folks who are leaving your house, would they-- Would-would you be concerned about them, there'll be a taxi. Sometimes designated drivers I--",question,0
Hi Billy. How are you doing?,question,0
Okay. You're very ready. Why do you think you picked a 10 instead of a lower number like 8?,other,3
"Okay. Well, if you're willing, then we could set up another appointment where you could come in and we could talk more about that.",therapist_input,1
Okay. Anything that your mom could do to help you with that?,question,0
"It's like, ""Wow,"" it's really, really prevalent for you right now, you realize that you are the caretaker, you are the person who listens to other people but you don't necessarily have someone like that for you and so—",reflection,2
"So you're kind of worried about how, where this is going to lead to.",reflection,2
-and-and-and you're talking about stuff.,reflection,2
I wondered if we could spend just a couple of minutes talking about your weight.,question,0
And the choices that you might have about it.,reflection,2
"What have you got in mind, what do you want from us?",question,0
"Okay. So, it would be pretty easy. So, if it's pretty easy, what do you need to do next, Billy?",question,0
"So you shared that you're, um, here today because you're having some dissatisfaction with your body and your confidence and your mood and your energy. And you're looking for, um, some different patterns to kind of turn things around for yourself. And what I like to do as I get to know clients is-is let them know a little bit about my philosophies, about health and wellbeing. Um, but first, I'd love to hear what are your philosophies about health and wellbeing?",question,0
Like what's going to be fastest.,reflection,2
"I promise you, you're not in trouble, I wanna help.",therapist_input,1
"So, Jill, um, I know you're here to talk about your blood pressure today.",reflection,2
[chuckles] You're glad to keep him as a doctor?,reflection,2
"Wow, that she's been showing you and making you read.",reflection,2
How-how often do you do that?,question,0
And it feels like the only way that you can really stay safe and not fall is to not do anything to kind of just hunker down.,reflection,2
That's right. You're rehabilitated.,reflection,2
"It's you that I'm worried about, Sal. It's you that I'm worried about, okay? The-the symptoms are worse. You've had two or three major asthma attacks. And-and do you appreciate how-- This is, uh, a risk to your life that there are some-some adults with severe asthma who actually can die as a result of their symptoms? It-it truly is something to take very, very seriously. I can't emphasize that enough.",therapist_input,1
"Mm. I'm not saying that the pain's in your mind. Um, I guess what I'm saying is that sometimes the way that we feel, and the way that our lives are going, can impact how we notice our symptoms. Given that we've tried medication for you, and we've tried investigations, and we've drawn a blank really, with those, none of those have really helped you-",reflection,2
"It went well. Good. Excellent. I did notice quite a lot of staining, actually. I'm wondering what are your thoughts about what might be related to that.",therapist_input,1
I kind of see a sense of sadness there when you have to kind of think about this.,reflection,2
"Right. So, these different tablets that you've got from the-",other,3
How much does it actually cost you a week?,question,0
Mm-hmm. So it's hard to actually say no to your friends-,reflection,2
"-""Look, Ken, you know, I'll come in, report in, I'm outta here.""",other,3
Uh-huh. Uh-huh.,other,3
"So, it sounds like you're ready. You're ready to give this up.",reflection,2
"Yeah. So-so maybe you- if you- if you wanted to, and this is really up to you, you could check out the blogs, you know. Um, I can see if I can track him down and stuff and the John Howard Society. And, um, I'd be really interested if-if you wanna get together to see what you have found out.",therapist_input,1
"But it's not something that you wanna make a habit of becoming reliant on, or dependent?",reflection,2
"-being one of the few left smoking in your crowd, and not liking the smell. That sounds like three reasons.",reflection,2
Mm-hmm. Okay. [unintelligible 00:24:52] something you'd be willing to try. Okay.,therapist_input,1
"It's just there? Okay. And, I'm curious, you mentioned, you know, your friends are important to you, and your family's important to you, and, sort of fitting in is important to you. How does alcohol play a role with that?",question,0
What kind of work is the most difficult for you in your job?,question,0
"So, uh, you know, we-we need to start looking at doing all those different things to get your diabetes under control 'cause your-your number is very high.",therapist_input,1
"So Auckland, coming to Auckland from Palmerston for you was-was like taking charge of something that you were going to look to make something different in your life?",question,0
Okay. And how often do you think you would say you're drinking?,question,0
"Sure. So, Jean, I want to make sure that I've understood what you've told me of what you find good about smoking. So it helps you calm down. It gives you something to do. It's been part of your image. You know, you feel sophisticated. You feel like a movie style. In fact, the way you talk about it, it seems like that's what it makes you feel like. Is that right?",reflection,2
"Mmh. Yeah, say something more about that. It sounds really interesting about you knowing that you get bored really easily.",therapist_input,1
"-one with cars, one that-",reflection,2
Okay. And what got you back?,question,0
"Okay. Well, the reason why I like to talk to patients when they fill out this form is because sometimes, uh, alcohol use can impact our health. Um, and my role is to be helpful. I can share some information with you about alcohol use, um, but I don't tell anyone what to do. It's always up to the patient to decide what they wanna do about their drinking. Um, so is it okay if we talk a little bit more about your alcohol use?",question,0
"Okay. Ah, there's-",reflection,2
How might that go?,question,0
Hmm. So what I hear you saying is this neighbor was supportive when you really needed her to be.,reflection,2
"-um, that you consume during the week?",reflection,2
"So, my sense is that you're smoking and you're minimizing hi-his exposure by not smoking in the same room and smoking near windows. Is that-",therapist_input,1
"Okay. So you-- that's cutting back quite a bit. That's a big step. So since we're kind of running out of time here today, I'm wondering if we could-- would be willing to come back in about four weeks to review this plan?",question,0
-a conversation inside. What other ideas do you have about what you could do?,question,0
"While this baby feels like this is your second chance, you're wondering, ""Do I deserve that second chance?"" And then this other part of you that says, ""Why not? It's here and I wanna go for it.""",reflection,2
Because its genes or the-the-the-the hereditary factor is not the only factor that causes it or is involved in it happening to you. So there's other factors that come into play.,therapist_input,1
"Okay. So, how are you gonna quit drinking without your friends thinking you look stupid?",question,0
"That's okay. Well, I know that you are making an effort. I do appreciate then and when-when I do stop by that you still sign the paperwork even though you feel like it's annoying at times. So, thank you for, uh, at least doing that.",other,3
You said before you're sort of guy that once you make a decision you're pretty staunch with that decision.,reflection,2
That's that the only solution.,other,3
"Yeah, sounds like a good idea.",other,3
"Sure, yeah.",other,3
You feel like you're not really paying as much attention to them as you would want to?,reflection,2
"Okay, Yeah.",other,3
-of how much you can drink to have some of the positive benefits but not cross over.,reflection,2
Mm-hmm. I see- I see that your A1C or your blood glucose is very high.,therapist_input,1
"Even with this, you know, pretty horrendous schedule going on.",reflection,2
"There's a lot of decisions and a lot of change with your wife, with the new baby.",reflection,2
"So I'm wondering, you know, most of them butt-butts head on your friendships with those- with those guys.",other,3
"Yeah, you really feel like you need that reward.",reflection,2
"So, you kind of have this identity, dual identity going on. I wanna be that person, yet, that person-",reflection,2
A plus shining new guy.,reflection,2
All right. How often do you do that?,question,0
"Okay. So what-wh-- in the moment, what are you thinking?",question,0
Right. So every day you know where you're going.,reflection,2
Cause you wanna do the right thing because you're- because you're a good person and that's a- that's a really important value to you is that you- is that you help people out.,reflection,2
"Okay, so it's kind of a way to cope through stress?",reflection,2
"Mm-hmm, and what is it that's important to you about getting home?",question,0
"So the things about that have got you into trouble in the past, um, how confident are you that, um, that you can do something to not keep going down the same path? Zero is like, ""I'm not confident at all that I can make any changes,"" and 100 is like, ""I'm so supremely confident."" Where would you be?",question,0
"Great. Well, I look forward to checking in with you, and thanks so much for coming in.",other,3
"Absolutely, we're in the right place for that.",other,3
"Yeah. Yeah. And there are things that have gotta work for you, so that-",reflection,2
Is he your fiance or your boyfriend?,question,0
Okay. What classes are you not getting A's and B's in?,question,0
"Yeah, yeah, yeah. And- so you don't want to hurt yourself.",reflection,2
"Yeah. So let me see if I had this. So y- so you got some positives, the-the awareness, and then you feel kinda on your game?",reflection,2
Uh-huh. Why do you say six or seven rather than like a four?,question,0
"Okay. Um, any questions about that? Any questions about kind of the next steps from here?",question,0
-your life and causing you a lot-,other,3
It sounds like bad luck.,reflection,2
Okay. That sounds good.,other,3
"And you really wanna do what's best for your babe. And kind of wondering, um, how to move forward from here, is that where you wanna, you know, kind of focus in on, or what are your thoughts about giving up drinking altogether?",question,0
"So to summarize, it sounds like you are still feeling kind of anxious about this test coming up, you've rescheduled it, um, over the past couple years. Yet, this time around, you seem more confident to just get it done. And you've even mentioned times in the past where you were feeling anxious and you were successful about it and that you felt proud about yourself. And you liked the way it means, you see yourself and how others saw you, and it seems like y-you're ready to finish this exam and-and remind yourself that you can be successful?",reflection,2
"Okay. Well, I don't see any redness. Um, can you go ahead and touch that Miguel, and tell me if it feels warm to you or if it hurts?",question,0
A slightly more sedate lifestyle.,reflection,2
That must have been scary.,other,3
So you're kind of stuck being exposed to things you don't need to see.,reflection,2
"And if you arrange to meet somebody there, you're very good at, uh, you know, uh, keeping the agreement.",therapist_input,1
"Okay. Well, good. Um, all right. It sounds like you've got a good plan there going forward. Um, now I did see from the nurse practitioner's notes, you're also working on reducing your smoking and your drinking. How's that going?",question,0
Yeah. yeah.,other,3
"So, your-your friends that you were hanging out with, there's a little tension there now.",reflection,2
So--,other,3
"When you related that to your smoking, so you managed to reduce your smoking.",reflection,2
Okay. What a great goal. So why do you want to make this goal for yourself?,question,0
"Um, and-and I'm sure that does seem kind of confusing too 'cause I'm sure you've got a lot of other people involved in your life right now with the courts I'm sure, I know that your mom is concerned about you as well and there's this one other person kinda checking in on you as well.",reflection,2
Cool.,other,3
"- and quite happy, that somehow your symptoms seemed less.",other,3
"Okay. If I asked you to pick a number, 0 through 10, 0 meaning you're not very confident at all in meeting your goal, or 10 meaning you're very confident, what number would you pick?",therapist_input,1
Mm-hmm. What else do you think it would take for you to feel safe?,other,3
"So, it sounds like, you know, the amount you drink is pretty normal-",reflection,2
"And, um, I’m just trying to imagine what do you think your mom would want to say to you if she was sitting here with us now and she heard you talking about this?",question,0
"Mm-hmm. So you're trying to, like you said, not engage in really dangerous activities?",question,0
"And we can work together to make sure that-- And-and Dr. Fields too, I know, is very interested in that. We can work together to do what we can to keep you there.",therapist_input,1
Anything else?,question,0
"Oh, um, yeah, I think that should be fine.",therapist_input,1
Okay. What did the doctor tell you cholesterol statin is for?,question,0
"The other thing I was going to tell you is that, unfortunately, uh, even though you are smoking outside and keeping the smoke away from her, the smoke on your clothes, because her lungs are so sensitive, can also affect her lungs and cause her to have a reaction. Now, something I'd like you to think about is that, if you use the chronic inhaler every day, she may not be sensitive to the smoke on your clothes, but she still maybe because her lungs are just very different than ours. Um, honestly, I'd love to see you quit smoking for you too because, you know, as you know, it's not real good for you.",therapist_input,1
"Well, I guess, thinking a little bit about those other areas of your life, um, uh, I'm thinking about the fact that over the last four years, your life's really changed. It seems to have really shrunk down.",other,3
"So well, maybe you can help her as well and that would be good. Well, I think you've got off to a really great start, Mr. Green. You're very well aware of what you-you need to do, and you've obviously thought about it and got some good plans in place. So you're going to reduce your-your alcohol intake, you've already started by reducing your salt intake. Um, perhaps when we meet up next time we could talk a little bit about smoking and exercise as well, when you're ready for that. So how do you feel now?",reflection,2
If that would help.,other,3
You do. you have beautiful teeth as I always tell you-,other,3
So we know that smoking and Type II diabetes together-,therapist_input,1
"Food is meant to be enjoyed, and it's a source of pleasure. So I'd want to help you certainly look for ways to add more fruits and vegetables and-and things that nourish your body, but also look for ways to add pleasure-",other,3
"Exactly. I'll tell you what might be a nice solution, is if you come down first appointment, and I give you an appointment at 8:30-",other,3
So how is it working to help you fit in?,question,0
"Well, let's do some checking out.",therapist_input,1
"It's so interesting because there's immediate feedback. I mean, that's immediate feedback. Um, so we're- we're talking about quitting or here quitting completely. What thoughts do you have? You tried the Chan- the Chantix, meditation, you like that so, um, I can run some ideas that some other clients have used [crosstalk]-",question,0
"Thanks, Hailey. We'll see you next week.",other,3
[laughter],other,3
"So, it's not really a priority for you right now, to be charging it?",reflection,2
"At the same time, you have some concerns about the possibility of getting pregnant.",reflection,2
"Okay. Right. Uh, to be honest, you know, looking there, it just looks like one of those viruses that are going around at the moment that are causing these sore throats. So, uh, I think that we should just perhaps go for a bit of paracetamol and, uh, some fluids and let nature sort it out.",therapist_input,1
Hmm. So that's a huge stress right now?,reflection,2
"So-so on the one hand, the doctor talked to you about high cholesterol, down the line possibly causing a stroke or heart attack-",reflection,2
"So, an event at your house.",reflection,2
They'll come.,reflection,2
"So aside from that social aspect, what are the things you like about it?",question,0
"Mm-hmm. Well, I just wanted to just show you this little chart here. For your age as a male, you're drinking more than those at a low-risk level. Um, the low-risk level for men under 65 is no more than 14 drinks a week and no more than four a day. And, in this case, a drink is considered 12 ounces of beer, 5 ounces of wine, or an ounce and a half of distilled spirits. And you're right, you're not drinking as much as some people out there. The way you answered our questions here, you're actually falling in the high-risk category, the risky or hazardous category, category two.",therapist_input,1
"But, Tommy, there's so many consequences with drinking. You know, you're not even 21 yet, you could get arrested, you could, you know, have a drunk driving accident. You could, you know, mess up your schoolwork. You have such a bright future ahead of you. It just really, really concerns me.",therapist_input,1
What are the main reasons why you actually smoke? What do you enjoy most about it?,question,0
"Yeah, is that on your top five also",question,0
"And I'd like you to be able to tell me what kinds of things that you can do right now. You know, for example, there- there's basically three things that need to be worked out with diabetes. Taking your medicine as prescribed. And honestly, if I was gonna work on one thing right away, given that everything seems so overwhelming would probably that-that first, because that'll have the biggest impact. How-how does that sound so far?",therapist_input,1
"Yeah, that's great. That's a really good goal.",other,3
"It’s really tough. It's hard to know where to start, isn't it?",reflection,2
"-by people me. So what I'm picking up is-is-is that if you've-you've got this long 12-year history, you can make some big money or you can dealing, doing crime, that stuff, I'm-I'm picking up that Fiona's set the bottom line, is if you go back in that lifestyle, she's out of here, yet she stayed here for 13, 12, 13 years?",reflection,2
"Okay. So let me make sure I've understood this piece as well. So the not good things or the not so good things about smoking for you are the effects on your health, effects on your physical appearance and how you'll look and-and-and the amount of investment that you're making in makeup and getting your nails done, et cetera. And then the cost of smoking.",reflection,2
"Uh, what else can you tell me about your drinking.",question,0
"-with the Wellbutrin, yes.",reflection,2
Right. And they got questions too-,reflection,2
And sometimes you feel guilty after you drink.,therapist_input,1
"All right. And Type II diabetes typically people have a resistance or a resistance to insulin in their cells, in their fat cells or their muscle cells or liver cells. They can't use insulin. And so sugar builds up in your system.",therapist_input,1
"He's right. This medicine is designed to help lower your cholesterol, and that means that it will help lower your risk of having a heart attack or a stroke. How did your doctor tell you to take this medicine?",reflection,2
"Have folks in to-to socialize for an event, and that you still have your-your social-- Your friends and your core group and-and, uh, just be careful. What was the six months of not drinking like for you? If you were to choose to not drink.",question,0
So am I hearing that it's tricky in some ways to hang out with them sometimes-,reflection,2
"And, so you're-you're an independent guy-",reflection,2
"Okay. Well, just remind me again why it is you want to stop.",question,0
"We know marijuana has effects on the developing brain. For example, it can make it harder for you to concentrate, it can make it harder for you to remember things, and vaping can seriously hurt your lungs. About one in six people who begin using marijuana as a teenager, later on, become addicted. So what do you think about all this information that I've shared?",therapist_input,1
You were right.,reflection,2
"Okay, sounds good.",other,3
So you'd like to have a little bit more support-,reflection,2
"Okay. Um, and if you lost your job, what do you see being the consequences of that?",question,0
Hmm. Yeah. And I-I can see that you've already worked hard to make some changes. You've almost quit smoking.,reflection,2
"Any other family members that, uh, live close that, uh, you think would be supportive?",question,0
-and picked up some forms?,question,0
"Okay, so you're willing to at least attempt it?",reflection,2
That creates problems?,question,0
Okay. Is this the first time that you've left home?,question,0
"And I mentioned that's somewhere where you don't feel so confident, and I'm wondering what it would be like to feel confident with reading and writing. What difference would that make to your life?",question,0
"Okay, great. Um, so with your community service I know you've got 25 hours left to do, um, so that does need to get done by the end of your probation, and your case manager is a really great resource to help you find a place where you can do it. So I know in the past some clients have done their community service at food pantries or shelters, or anywhere in the community that's not, you know, a family member or a friend. Um, the urban ecology center is a really great place. You can kind of work outside, work with younger kids. Do any of those options seem like a fit that you might be interested in?",therapist_input,1
"Okay. All right. So, let's talk about that, um, so we should just assume we're gonna be at a four.",reflection,2
"-you really liked, you feel that you would be pretty confident to deal with the stuff that gets you into trouble?",reflection,2
"It wasn't perhaps about the police singling you out. So those little things, well, you think, ""Mm, yeah, maybe-maybe if I'd done something differently, I wouldn't have ended up in trouble."" How interested are you in thinking about those things and-",therapist_input,1
"When you find someone to go with, great, if not, you get your own [unintelligible 00:08:12] your own music and uh, I'll be- I'll be trying just to-to see um, what is like for you, having actually done that [unintelligible 00:08:20]",reflection,2
"Okay, so at this point, you're not too concerned and you think that, you know, this is what the other students are doing?",reflection,2
[unintelligible 00:01:40],other,3
Sounds like drinking changes how you think in those moments?,reflection,2
"Mm-hmm, mm-hmm. So I see this is- this is something you've been thinking about for a while. So how far away do you think you are from that change? You know, 'cause obviously it can-can be on the never, never, but how far away are you from it, making some decisions about that?",question,0
"Well, I guess what I'd be wondering is whether one of the approaches we need to be using now is thinking about what you do with your life, and what you do with your day, and maybe trying to bring back some of those pleasurable things, you know, even if it's just meeting up-",therapist_input,1
"I know you were here to get a prescription for birth control but while you were waiting to see Mrs. Smith, you filled out a healthy habits questionnaire-",therapist_input,1
So for you to create opportunities to create those moments that you can have that feeling again,reflection,2
"Yeah, but you're one of the leaders.",therapist_input,1
"Mm-hmm. Well, that's the time when you can relax and unwind.",reflection,2
"So it sounds like you've made some good changes. The change in your environment, and some of your behaviors, and, uh, and these new friends.",reflection,2
Because you know that other people experience it too.,reflection,2
You seem at a loss of where to go from here.,reflection,2
"Well, one of the primary risk factors for multiple ear infections in kids is actually smoke exposure. Are you smoking?",question,0
"Mm. You're a very successful student and you have a lot of responsibilities, and it's really adding to your stress.",reflection,2
"Well, we have about, I guess, 15 or 20 minutes together and I wonder, would it be okay, if we took a couple of minutes and just kind of looked at all of the different things that are going on for you and maybe you can let me know, what would be the most helpful to spend-spend some time on?",question,0
"Yeah, it does. It sounds like a lot that you're trying to deal with, and it makes sense that you feel like you need some kind of break or reward.",reflection,2
"So sort of, um, trying to plan more activities that don't involve alcohol-",reflection,2
Tell me more about that.,question,0
"So, it's not just wine that helps you relax. Um, there's reading a book, watching a movie, and taking a hot bath too.",reflection,2
"Molly, thank you so much for coming over and yakking with me today.",other,3
"All right. So that sounds like a perfect place for you to store those. Medications are best when they're stored away from light, heat and moisture.",reflection,2
"Yeah. I think somewhat being tough with yourself, what-- yeah, people often say that, but, you know, it's not-- I think there are some things that you can do, and you've already-already identified a really good strategy.",therapist_input,1
"This other lifestyle over here though when we talk about, actually thinking about, you know, doing stuff, doing the stuff that-that everybody else generally does, [unintelligible 00:22:30] will gets on doing, it doesn't have that same kinda seem to excitement, and it doesn't seem to be a-a starting point for you over here.",reflection,2
"Yet, at the same time, I know running around and getting in trouble for being naked or having to go to the hospital, not such a good thing either. Um, I'm wondering if, um- if I could run some ideas by you that some other patients of mine have tried?",question,0
Yeah. I bet you're even better now.,therapist_input,1
"Yeah, what-what would you be saying?",question,0
"Hey, hi, Andrea. Thanks for coming in today. So I don't know how much you've been told about why you're here, but basically, it's my job just to meet with all the students. I usually meet with you once or twice a semester. And I'm going to be talking to you kind of about your life and your goals and some behaviors that you might engage in and just the sorts of things like that.",reflection,2
"Right, so you make--",other,3
"-it will do whatever you need it to do at any given time. The downside is-is it-it kinda get, it gets in the end with the health.",therapist_input,1
"Oh, that's a great question. So, a lot of times, kids who are trying to cut back, it's harder if their friends are still drinking, and one of the easiest things is trying to have more activities that don't involve alcohol, but-",therapist_input,1
But you did have some success. Tell me how you felt when you lost the weight.,reflection,2
Okay. He's thinking you were a little irresponsible.,reflection,2
"Mm, okay. So what sort of things do you think made it a waste of time last time?",question,0
Anything else happening with Methamphetamine in your life? Is it affecting you in any way?,question,0
"If you did decide to quit on a scale of 1 to 10, where 1 is not at all confident, and you don't think you could do it and 10 is you feel pretty certain that you could, where do you think you fall right now?",question,0
That-that you're up for the money and-and then-then they slot you.,reflection,2
"Mm, okay.",other,3
"Absolutely. Spot on. So stopping smoking would have a huge impact, that would have a big impact very early on. Losing weight would also have a big impact because that would help with your blood pressure, your cholesterol, and also lower your diabetes risk. So what-what'd you think about those things? Uh,",question,0
"But, maybe the path to doing that isn't so clear.",reflection,2
"Yeah. So I think just tell your friends you know, you realized there's always bad things about it and you don't want to do it anymore, so you're just not going to.",therapist_input,1
-it's just that that we're gonna try and drill down a little more into just to pick up for you what-what you think might be going on and what you think might be some of the options for you.,therapist_input,1
"You'd say an eight. Okay. And on a scale of 1 to 10, how confident are you at the present time that you can drink below risk levels?",question,0
"I agree. All right. Well, you-you know what? I'm not gonna start any medications today. Your levels were a little bit off, but I think we can handle this from a purely lifestyle standpoint. What do you think?",therapist_input,1
But it's not inevitable.,therapist_input,1
"Uh, and so at this point, you're gonna get the medication and-",therapist_input,1
"So, from your perspective, do you see any consequences to your smoking?",question,0
And-and also the support of your mom too.,reflection,2
"So, the whole thing about going back to poly-- going back to school-",reflection,2
"Oh, wow. Okay. Why do you say 10?",question,0
How about we start there and let's plan to follow up in a few weeks so we can see how it's going and then maybe talk about some other strategies that might help.,therapist_input,1
"-and kinda. Okay, great. All right, well, one of the things I wanna talk about is, you know, um, you mentioned that you'd like to go out with friends and-and party, and that sort of a thing. And, I'm curious, when you're out in the parties, do you ever have any alcohol?",question,0
"Mm-hmm. If I was to put it on a scale of say 1 to 100, 1 being not really important, 100 being really, really important, whereabouts on that scale would you you be?",question,0
"Yeah. That's-that's what I'm thinking- I'm thinking actually. Here's someone that actually has made a different decision then, uh, it sounds like that's the pathway that starts over here and I'm wondering. I wonder whether you might have wisdom about what it's like to t-to tread that path.",reflection,2
"Yeah. Is that something that, um, maybe you and I could meet again about-and talk about having those conversations with-with the family, maybe having conversations about, you know, the folks, your-your friends that are currently in the lifestyle that you were involved with, um, and then sort of what it would look like to go down path B, is that something that you would be open to meeting with me about again?",question,0
"-the unpleasantness of that. Okay. What else might be on the, not so good side about smoking- about stopping?",question,0
-if you're always running around taking care of everybody.,therapist_input,1
"So, Chris, I wanted to talk to you. Um, you know, you're one of our star athletes. I really value you as a team player. As Athletic Director, one of my jobs is to, kind of, keep tabs on the players and make sure everybody is performing at their best. And something came up this weekend. I've been hearing some chatter about a big party that went down and understand you were there. And so I wanted to talk to you a little bit about how partying and alcohol fits in your life right now.",therapist_input,1
-and what are your top five?,question,0
It could be very different.,other,3
Bye.,other,3
-that you've wanted for some time.,reflection,2
"So, what you're saying is you've had a rough night?",reflection,2
Kind of slow?,question,0
Okay. Similar sort of offending in the past that's brought you back again this time?,question,0
"Um, so yeah, you know, it really sounds to me like you have a good plan in place and as long as you're willing and-and interested in meeting again, I'd be very excited to be able to talk with you about how it's going.",reflection,2
"All right. Um, okay. Um, well let's, uh, let's just have a look shall we? See what's going on. You just wanna open your mouth for me. Say ah.",therapist_input,1
-or just local?,question,0
"Okay. Good. Very good. All right. Well, what are the kinds of things do you do for fun on weekends?",question,0
"Let me see if I can summarize what you've said, um, and then we'll see what next. Um, you lead a busy life.",reflection,2
And you-- So they have their concerns and-and you are beginning to-to ask questions of this use as well and-,reflection,2
"Actually, even just a few minutes of walking is really healthy and worthwhile, and then when you have time to do even more, that's great. Walking is also great because you can do it anywhere, it doesn't need to be at the gym.",therapist_input,1
Am I missing anything else?,question,0
So what is a typical week for you as far as your alcohol use?,question,0
"Hmm. And it sounds like your smoking, setting an example, those are some things that-that you're also, uh, a bit concerned about, um, but as you said earlier, not-not really ready to put down your cigarettes immediately.",reflection,2
"Okay. Get your rocking out, running on the elliptical playlist.",reflection,2
- pretty clear that there's nothing new happening that-that we're missing.,therapist_input,1
Okay. All right.,other,3
"Yeah, you feel more accomplished and-and you feel less irritated by the small stuff.",reflection,2
The elliptical. Okay. Yeah. [unintelligible 00:03:07] like kind of almost like running.,other,3
"Well, I-I-I understand that. Um, but like I said, it's very rare. If you feel some muscle weakness, you'll let your doctor know. It's not permanent, okay? Yeah, it won't get to the blood- it won't get to the point where it affects your job—",therapist_input,1
"So when you see it here in kind of black and white, you're not sure if this is, uh, you know, enough-",reflection,2
I guess that it does.,other,3
So there is a possibility that there are other parts of the scene that don't rely on drug use-,reflection,2
"Okay, oh, that-that's excellent, okay.",other,3
"So, I'm gonna ask the question this way, on a scale of 0 to 10, where 0 is not at all confident, and 10 is like, ""I'm very, very confident,"" where would you put yourself on a scale right now of confidence in starting this new plan?",question,0
"Okay. So what I hear you say is that it was a bigger challenge than you expected, yeah, but you're working on it. You're-you're still committed to it. So yeah, that's really to be commended. I just want to ask you one thing though. Have you thought about secondhand smoke and the dangers of that and how that might be impacting your son?",reflection,2
"-sounds really, you know, like it's making you feel good about yourself and—",reflection,2
Why?,question,0
"Okay. Well, I really appreciate you spending the time talking to me, you know, it sounds like you have a lot of really good goals for yourself, really ambitious goals of going to medical school and, you know, becoming a psychiatrist or, um, some-some other form of physician. Um, you're really looking forward to doing well in school so you can get there.",reflection,2
"It really-- You're in the driver's seat, so it's just to kind of put all the cards on the table, so to speak.",other,3
"Speaker 1: Okay. You checked the box here that drinking helps you feel relaxed, feel better about yourself or fit in?",question,0
"sI see from the questionnaire, did you have got in trouble while using alcohol? Can you tell me more about that?",question,0
Yeah. And it sounds like you're willing to maybe try not going to the bar quite as much and maybe drinking a little bit less when you go to the bar.,reflection,2
It's because you showed up and you gave out,reflection,2
"Oh, yeah?",question,0
"Okay. Um, so you said that your wife said it's a problem. Um, so do you not feel like it's a problem for you?",question,0
CEO.,reflection,2
So you've made our decision to do that?,reflection,2
"Yeah, yeah, yeah.",other,3
"-and you're on a team, you have to stick by the rules.",therapist_input,1
Okay. That's the second time you've used that word 'guilty'.,other,3
So I don't know how much you know already about sort of my role here and why you're even here. So I thought I'd start by telling you a little bit about myself.,other,3
-when you eat. That's one aspect. What other aspects do you think you've-- you would be--?,question,0
"The test, is the test, and experience, yeah.",therapist_input,1
Palmerston. Mm-hmm.,reflection,2
What could be a- what could be a first step towards that?,question,0
"Yeah. Okay, so you've been-- How long have you had this-this idea for that that's what you'd like and that's where you'd like to go?",question,0
"Right. So you've been able to quit smoking, but only when you were in the hospital.",reflection,2
"Okay. So-so Donna's helped calm you down and you'd like, um, them to calm down too?",question,0
"On the one hand, you- the drinking maybe helps with the belonging community to start.",reflection,2
"You know, and, um, that's actually, yeah, that's a-- I think it does become very paired with lots of different things. And, um, you might already know this, and so let me know if you do, um, because of the way cigarettes you're describing it and accurately is-- it is really what we call an almost perfect drug in a lot of ways. And-",therapist_input,1
"I know uh, some clients have struggled with understanding that I really do care about you. And you know that when we first met that you had expressed a goal of, um, getting off this program as quickly as possible.",other,3
What's your hunch? Yeah.,question,0
"Yeah. So I'm wondering, um, if there are things that you think, ""Well, I can see that that's got me into trouble,"" and, you know, kind of cops aside, things that might have got you into-into trouble.",other,3
-and what the tests say kind of like don't join up.,reflection,2
"Yeah, okay. Um, and-and so that's a lot going on right now for you? Yeah.",reflection,2
Okay. And what sort of situations are you in?,question,0
- a cancer. Is that-- Have I got the-,reflection,2
"Uh, yeah, it does. Uh, I am yet to- it-it seems to me just in this time we've been talking together that you, um, um, do have a sense that a lot of it has to do-do with, uh, timing, luck, who you know, and being, are you able to have that conversation where you know that you can sell yourself and your skills and, um, and your competencies and the fact that you've overcome so many things like, um, substance abuse problem and, uh, have been, you know, uh, a good upstanding citizen all this time. Um, to me, if I were an employer, you know, I would- I would be impressed with that.",reflection,2
"Okay, yes, so you’ve got this real sense of, ""I've gotta do something.""",reflection,2
"I don't-- you tell me. I mean, um, you're-you're drinking four a day.",therapist_input,1
That's a priority.,reflection,2
"Generally, it works well if you find a time when you're not under a huge amount of other stresses and strains.",therapist_input,1
"Well, what-what are her hopes for you, Billy?",question,0
"Well, Ruth, it sounds like you're very frustrated first of all. And you're saying that you're just tired. You've lost all your willpower.",reflection,2
"Yeah. Yeah, so-so, you fluttered last night with them?",question,0
Okay. But it sounds to me too like part of you really does want to quit?,reflection,2
"Mm-hmm. Well, in this country, the guidelines are men can drink up to 14 drinks a week or up to four on one occasion and still be low risk.",therapist_input,1
"Well, how do you think your drinking relates to the depression you've experienced?",question,0
"Yeah. Okay. So, what I'm really interested in is how offending fits in with that picture, that dream.",question,0
"Yeah. So why-why do you want to-- what do you wanna do with that? You want to look different, or--?",question,0
I gotcha. Okay.,other,3
"Okay. Well, your sanction is you'll be placed on university disciplinary probation and you'll have to attend an alcohol education seminar that'll cost you $150. Also, disciplinary action is progressive and cumulative, meaning that any further violations will result in suspension for one semester or longer.",therapist_input,1
All right. Do you have any concerns at all about your alcohol use?,question,0
"Okay, I can respect that. You-you really have to go with kind of your gut and follow your own intuition on that. Um, what about the baby's father, is he of any help?",question,0
"Okay, yeah yeah sure, you're already taking a huge step forward in many ways by coming along to-to start talking about it.",other,3
"Well, I don't know about that. Um. That-- you know, it's really important that you get your, um, not just your cardiovascular-- that's a good idea for the cardiovascular, but also, you know, your, um, weightlifting, the [inaudible 00:01:32] [crosstalk]",therapist_input,1
"Oh, that was blackout type?",question,0
"So your-your-your doctor told you that if your cholesterol remains elevated, you're at risk of stroke or heart attack?",therapist_input,1
"Okay, so she's- she's got a job.",reflection,2
"No, no. That's--",therapist_input,1
It might be a bit extreme to-,reflection,2
"And, uh, um, you do this how often?",question,0
"Well, great. I recommend that you not use Methamphetamine at all but what you do is up to you.",therapist_input,1
"Right, right. It's just like you-you-you-- Some people pick a quit date, like January 1st is still the most popular quit date—",therapist_input,1
The-the availability of it is there.,reflection,2
"Okay, so you've got some people in your life who are vulnerable to possible illness, and making this decision to get the flu shot will help protect them.",reflection,2
"Okay. Well, I've got a brochure here and this has-- it's a really good brochure. It has some distraction techniques in it in case you get those nicotine cravings. So it's-",therapist_input,1
So that's actually kind of a lot of drinking then?,reflection,2
You have been giving this a lot of thought.,other,3
What other positive things have you noticed about the exercise?,question,0
"I-I didn't know that. So I, you know, I know a little bit about it, um, and not, yeah. So that's-that's very interesting. Oh, what about advocacy groups?",therapist_input,1
"That would be entirely up to you, um, to-to have that.",therapist_input,1
"Hi, Emily. How are you?",question,0
Quite invigorated with the idea of--,reflection,2
"Let me ask another question and follow up to that. Again, given everything going on, where 10 is the most confident you've ever felt about anything and 1 is the least confident, how confident are you that you will be able to quit?",question,0
"Okay, that's fine. Okay. So, Barbara, I'm seeing you today, um, but I think it's usually Dr. Brown that sees you, is that right?",question,0
"So your dog, and-and the doctor's saying the dog's—",reflection,2
So you feel slow.,reflection,2
-and I'm wondering if you feel like there's support there. They have a lot of activities going on at the senior center that- and I- and I don't know what was in the Tai Chi included that might be- not only serve the purpose of the exercise but really help with some of that support.,therapist_input,1
"So, kind of keeping your options open.",reflection,2
"Hi, Mrs. Smith. I wanted to let you know that at this appointment, we're gonna be giving Lilly some vaccines.",therapist_input,1
Sure. [chuckling] It's not a secure profession-,reflection,2
All right. Shake.,question,0
Okay. And how often do you have a drink containing alcohol?,question,0
Okay and what-what did you do about-- How did you try and conceal that or hide that?,question,0
"Financially. Right, getting back to the finances and you know, you know, you know I'm thinking your daughter what a pain but it's become the finances the emphysema. I'm really-- because I would think that in 10 years, how much are you smoking now?",question,0
"So what ideas do you have about initially just getting started, and what-what would you do [unintelligible 00:04:13] ?",question,0
So it sounds like--,other,3
"So if you made a decision to go there, it might be a scary as shit but again it seems that, uh, it could work if see it look, this is important, this relationship's important, let me go for—",reflection,2
All right. Great. So I'll-I'll plan to see you then in a few more weeks.,other,3
Meaningful.,reflection,2
"Hmm. Yeah. And-and in the end, you know, whatever you- whatever you do, about Oscar, about your asthma, about all the other things that we talked about on that agenda-setting worksheet, I mean, you are in the driver's seat solid. It really is your choice.",other,3
So what's special about Donna?,question,0
"So, we'll do that so we'll-we'll talk about the hypnosis a little bit more, you know, you'll talk to your doc. Um, you'll do your research, you know, about programs and stuff, I'll give you any information I have and we'll take it from there. But it's sounding like the quit date might be coming up fairly-- like within the next two, three months.",therapist_input,1
"Okay. Um, do you see your substance use as being, um, maybe a cause of those other issues at all? Do you see them linked at all?",question,0
"Um, and also look at activities that enhance your mood. We can also take a look at some dietary patterns and see if-if there are ways you could tweak how you're fueling your body throughout the day, but at the same time, sort of letting go of what happens on the scale. Letting go of, um, the final, you know, weight outcome of that, and really focusing instead on healing your relationship with food and also adopting sustainable physical activity patterns. What do you make of all that?",therapist_input,1
That’s great. All the very best then.,other,3
"Well, some of the common ones are nausea, vomiting, headache. There are some severe ones like dermatomyositis, liver failure, lupus, rhabdomyolysis, hemorrhagic cerebral infarction. If you have any of those, just call your doctor.",therapist_input,1
Tell me about Fiona?,question,0
"Since the-- since you used, uh-- since the last time you used meth, right?",question,0
"Okay, but part of the problem is those look deep and like you're going to have significant scars. So my suggestion is in the future, if you do it, is that you put some sort of bandaid on it to keep it closed. But let's talk about how, um, how this happened. First of all, tell me, you were telling me on that phone that you wanted to die. But, um, did you-- Was this a suicide attempt or do you think it was just-just a cutting? Were thinking of killing yourself or wanting to kill yourself or wanting to die when you did it?",therapist_input,1
"Okay, so you know what you want, you're not so sure that your boyfriend wants the same thing. His actions indicate that he doesn't.",reflection,2
You realize it's something you shouldn't have done.,reflection,2
You're not allowed to vote.,therapist_input,1
-first DUI that got you.,reflection,2
"And, you have a lot of friends or a few close people, or?",question,0
"Okay, so you don't have any cash and that's the stuff that causes you to do the small stuff-",reflection,2
It's individual. Yeah.,reflection,2
Okay. Can you tell me a little bit about that?,question,0
So you're still kinda concerned that you're not quite sure if you will be able to do this successfully?,question,0
Is that what you're saying? Yes?,question,0
Nice.,other,3
It is.,other,3
"-on the hospital floor, you know, for frequently.",reflection,2
"All right. Well, um, one of the things I wanted to talk to you about sort of relates to belonging and your friends. So what kinds of things do you like to do when you get together with your friends?",question,0
Want the good [crosstalk] no good right? And how long ago was that that you—,question,0
"Yeah. They'll come. As long as you got the money, they'll come and get you. Yeah.",other,3
To see if you can feel anything?,question,0
"No. But as I said, these medications-- so you've tried the medication, you've been willing once.",therapist_input,1
"Well, um, before you leave today, we'll go ahead and, um, I'll call the rehab center and make those arrangements.",other,3
"Certainly, certainly. I'm glad you're willing to talk to him. So before you leave here today, we'll, uh, stop by the scheduler's desk and make an appointment for you to see me back in four weeks, as well as the appointment with Dr. Kirtley. And that way, before you leave, you're all set. So do you have any other questions for me, Sarah?",question,0
It [unintelligible 00:09:33] picking up?,question,0
"Maybe. You're not convinced at the moment, I understand that and, um—",other,3
"Okay, so specifically getting some computer skills will help?",reflection,2
What would be special about you as a dad?,question,0
"Hello, there.",other,3
"Okay. Now, if the juice was still there, can you think of anything else you could do?",question,0
"It's just the scene that they're-they're still in because their life maybe hasn't taken that change that your life has made. And so now, you're here and you're not sure. You want the baby, but you're not sure about the suburbs and the picket fence thing. You're not sure—",reflection,2
"So what's something that you'd like to change or, um, work towards?",question,0
"Yeah, yeah. If you could just say, ""Ken, hi, I am starting to, you know, tune it out here, starting to get uncomfortable,"" that would be really helpful.",therapist_input,1
"So knowing that a couple of things can really get in your way, what do you think would work best for you to get to school on time? What do you know you need to do?",question,0
"Yeah, yeah. So if we were to think back, say the last month, the last four weeks, how many times would you have gone down to the- to the pokies, the pub?",question,0
"So you said the-the first one you said, you don't like the way it makes you feel?",question,0
"Okay, so how many do you usually have at a time?",question,0
In case you see someone overdosing?,reflection,2
Tell me a little bit about what brings you today.,question,0
You're willing to take steps to improve on that.,reflection,2
"Mm-hmm. Yeah. And-and sometimes, um, people have friends who are friends, but then there's friends who would stay on in our lives and are constant. So, these would be your constant core--",reflection,2
"It is. Well, just to help you, because there's probably a lot of other questions you might have, other questions that might come up after this session.",other,3
"Uh-huh. I think it's important, um, that you know that you're the one who has to make the decision about whether or not tai chi works for you.",other,3
"Um, how do you think that the drinking fits in with that?",question,0
"Thanks for coming in. Um, so, I'm not sure how much you know already about sort of what you're doing here. If it's okay, I'll give you a little rundown.",question,0
"So, to heal-- feel healthy for yourself as well be a good role model for your kids?",reflection,2
Sounds like a good plan.,reflection,2
"So, let's see. It looks that you put-- You drink alcohol at least four times a week on average-",therapist_input,1
But what are your goals for the long term?,question,0
"Okay. The muscle weakness with this drug is very rare, uh, usually doesn't even happen, okay? Uh, if it happens it usually happens within the first month of taking the medicine, you'll notice it in terms of weakness in the arms, uh, or some muscle pain, it's not usual. If this should happen, uh, if you let the doctor or me know right away, we can get you off the medicine, it's completely reversible. It's, the muscle weakness will go away within a couple of days, right.",therapist_input,1
Wow. That's a long time. What other instruments?,question,0
Okay. What plan could you come up with to make sure you achieve that goal?,question,0
Do you remember giving consent when you had sex?,question,0
"Sure. So what I'm hearing is, you're not convinced at the moment.",reflection,2
"All right. Um, so what do you think would be your next steps in working out a plan between your neighbor and your mom?",question,0
"Thanks. I want you to know that whenever patients and I talk about alcohol and drugs, my role is to share information and learn from what they want to do, if anything. Does that make sense?",therapist_input,1
All right. Okay.,other,3
"You know, it cuts your risk of falls in half. It also helps to reduce pain although that's not a short-term benefit, you do have to stick with it for at least three to six months to start have it help reduce your pain. But it does have a number of things that I think would get you to your goals of being home and able to play with your dog and doing your own cooking and things like that.",therapist_input,1
Okay. That's a big step and that's not the direction you want to go in right now.,reflection,2
Mm. So the drinking is something that we talked about can make it easier for you to offend.,reflection,2
And how do you help her now?,question,0
"-of places that you can work with, some phone numbers to call.",therapist_input,1
"So, on a scale from 1 to 10, 1 being not important and 10 being very important, where would you rate yourself on how important it is to start exercising more?",question,0
And what about your use do you not like?,question,0
Then so when you're-- so you're spending less time with them and more time with Donna?,question,0
"-so it took you back into it. All right. Let me just make sure I've understood what's going on here. You really want to stop smoking because you're kind of the last guy in your group still smoking, it costs a lot of money, and you don't really like the smell.",reflection,2
"So it was kind of been a part of your culture a little bit, and you know, just find alcohol, maybe takes the edge off a little bit and-",reflection,2
Does she want the- did she want the-the him that she fell in love with and saw great things in?,question,0
"Uh, why didn't you pick a six?",question,0
"Okay. So you're describing quite a lot there to me. So you're saying that you, you kind of got hot and sweaty, you said that you- you held the camera.",reflection,2
Right down the bottom? Down Bluff?,question,0
"Yeah, I know you've mentioned that in the past. When we were talking about the pros and cons of going out to one of these activities-",other,3
"Okay. The other things that need to be worked on over time certainly would be changing your eating habits, you know, to eat- eat healthier, uh, not necessarily less, but healthier. And the other thing would be getting, um, some more physical activity. And by the way, that doesn't mean going to a gym. That means things like more walking, maybe using stairs instead of an elevator or an escalator, stuff like that. Uh.",therapist_input,1
Yeah. So what's one thing you can do between now and the next time we meet?,question,0
"Okay. So, it sounds like you feel relaxed and have fun when you're drinking with friends and you like the taste.",reflection,2
"And maybe the effects um, also on-on your physical appearance. An interesting question around the effect of meth use on physical appearance.",reflection,2
Yeah? What-what's the confusing bit?,question,0
"So, is that surprising to you?",question,0
"Hi, Laura.",other,3
Yeah. And you don't like that?,question,0
"Okay, okay. Well, sometimes when people aren't ready to make changes like this, it helps if they write down their goals, it gives them a chance to see them in black and white. If you were to look at this little form here and figure out where you want to go with your drinking, what would you put down as your goal?",therapist_input,1
Blood pressure's a little on the high side.,therapist_input,1
"Mm-hmm. So but finally after three months, time went by-",reflection,2
So being an entre- being an entrepreneur fits for you.,reflection,2
"Okay. When-when somebody has asthma, their lungs are like hypersensitive. If I could use an analogy, again, if-if you had the skin burnt off your arm, if somebody brushed up against you before he had the skin burned off your arm, it wouldn't bother you at all. But when the skin's burned off your arm, you literally react to it. Her lungs are exquisitely sensitive. Uh, and like the skin on your arm would be if the skin got burned off. And what this drug can do? This chronic inhaler is reduce the inflammation in her lungs so that her lungs don't remain exquisitely sensitive. Because otherwise, everything in the air like dust, pollen, uh, reacts with her, uh, in ways that it would not normally affect us.",therapist_input,1
And-and you came-,reflection,2
What steps could you take to move that six to a seven or eight?,question,0
"Yeah. And so you felt you came about this change, and-and-and how does it make you feel?",question,0
You have?,question,0
Or-or not worth your time.,reflection,2
Okay. Those are the big ones for you.,reflection,2
"-been helpful, um, in-- with patients before. I'd also like to ask you, would you be willing to see one of our counselors?",question,0
I promise.,other,3
So what's been there? What's it about that you haven't done in three weeks one day?,question,0
"Absolutely, I appreciate you sharing that piece with me and you absolutely get to have that desire. And, um, we certainly are bombarded all day long with messages about how a body is supposed to look and so we all, um, certainly have moments of feeling dissatisfied with how our bodies look. And so you're absolutely, um, welcome to hold that and we can have space for that and you can certainly talk about that in these sessions. And I'll check in with you as we're going through the process of behavior change, um, to see how your body confidence is, um, as we talk more.",therapist_input,1
"Right, because you're noticing it's having a negative impact on what you're eating.",reflection,2
"Okay. And-and what do you- do you-- Some folks, you know, [unintelligible 00:03:18] put on music, kind of- kind of.",other,3
"All right. Well, some of the common side effects are nausea, vomiting, headache. There are some severe side effects like dermatomyositis, liver failure, lupus, rhabdomyolysis, hemorrhagic, cerebral infarction. If you have any of those, you should call your doctor.",other,3
"And with friends, you feel like it's easier to-to hang out with alcohol, or maybe you wouldn't have as much fun, or your friends wouldn't like you as much or?",reflection,2
Mm. You kind of wanna have the best of both worlds.,reflection,2
Really? So what I'm hearing is there's actually a lot of aspects in your life which are really good.,reflection,2
It just sounds like something's worrying you about that there's-there's a part link there but there's not a link and that-that maybe that the drugs is-is becoming a more important part in your life.,reflection,2
So staying in school and playing on the basketball team is important to you?,question,0
"Okay. So it sounds like you have quite a lot of thoughts rushing through your head then at the point where you get that invitation and you think, ""People will look, people will stare, people will think I'm a weirdo."" So there's quite a lot about what you- what you think other the people will think. And how does that make you feel?",reflection,2
"-night shift, petrol station.",reflection,2
"Okay. So it sounds like you have a lot of reasons why you'd like to quit. You have been successful quitting in the past, and right now you're just feeling a little bit hesitant about your ability to do it?",reflection,2
It sounds like you're drinking a bit more than that right now.,reflection,2
"Um, I noticed some yelling going on in the house, what's going on?",therapist_input,1
Absolutely. Okay.,other,3
So it sounds like-,other,3
"Oh, did you?",question,0
Mhm.,other,3
"Right. Yeah. Um, I was-- Maybe, you could tell me about how much you drank.",question,0
"-to your kids. So, is this dream starting to-- I am getting a picture of?",question,0
"All right. Well, um, I look forward to talking to you tomorrow. And I'm hoping that you're gonna be able to tell me that you went to the gym.",therapist_input,1
"Very hard. It's very relaxing, and-",reflection,2
"Mm, and I'm sorry, that's not how I mean to come across at all.",therapist_input,1
"Yeah, and-and one of the- certainly one of the risks of stroke is paralysis, and if you wanna be active that could be-",therapist_input,1
"Okay. What about in terms of talking to your friends about it, have you thought about how you might approach with them or is that something else you'd like some tips about, about telling them about your plan to-",question,0
And you accept that?,question,0
Wow.,other,3
All right. And how about your grades?,question,0
"So it seems like what's gonna push in this direction, just tip that balance a little bit to give this other world of go? Because it is new, it's different. It means doing stuff, a lot of stuff actually that-that's kind of mundane.",question,0
"Mm-hmm. So, what shifted that made it that you were actually able to go to the polytech and get the forms? What's shifted in you?",question,0
Okay. So you're- you're feeling fairly motivated.,reflection,2
-so you know that it's going to change.,reflection,2
"Yeah, yeah, I understand. So there are lots of places around that have it. Your local senior center would have it. And what I recommend is that you start by doing it in a chair. Just sitting in the chair.",therapist_input,1
"And see what you make of it. See if it fits a little bit more with where you're at. We know that there is a strong family factor or hereditary factor, so that's one aspect. So also it tends to happen a little bit later in life, rather than something you might get when you're a teenager, this type of diabetes. So-so it's a later onset. It takes a bit of time for it to develop maybe. And the main reason I think, um, the main aspect of it is that it, have you heard about insulin.",therapist_input,1
What would be the benefits of that?,question,0
"Okay. So as we're gonna do this work together and go through this, uh, this program, one of the things we-we don't want to do is fall into the same trough we did last time. So I-I just want to leave that with you to think about next time we come together. There may be two or three other people that you think of that can be really supportive, that we-we need to let know that you're [unintelligible 00:10:50] each gonna make these changes and this time, you're serious about it. So let your mother and, uh, and, um, your partner, how might that happen? How does that sound to you?",therapist_input,1
Would you like to do some research on this and give it a shot?,therapist_input,1
-and you haven't done that. So-so tell me what that's about.,question,0
"Like, that's the, I think, thing to really consider.",other,3
"And you're here today and that's probably something in you you've thought well I'll follow this through, you know I'll-I'll come along and see what-see what they've got to say. And I'm just wondering for this session, for the time we have today, there's a number of things we could talk about. You mentioned a couple of things about your lifestyle and, um, medication is one thing you've been told by the doctor you might need to do that. And a number of things that we could talk about today. Which-which area would you think would be useful for you to focus on?",question,0
"Yeah, yeah. I know what's worked for a lot of the-the folks that I've worked with is there's like- it's called a lifeline and they can wear it around their neck and it's hooked up and- so that if you need help, you can push the button.",therapist_input,1
So you're an occasional meth user. You don't use very often?,reflection,2
"Okay. So then even by you coming here today, Ruth, and talking to me and opening up and telling me that you don't feel like you want to continue moving in and telling me and-and confiding in me that, you know, you hurt yourself and all this pain that you feel, that is you trying to help yourself out in one way or another. And that shows that you care. And even more, it shows that you care about your mom and that, in the end, it doesn't sound like you wanna leave her alone because you're still worried about ot-you're still worried about all the burdens on her that you're even thinking of removing yourselves to make her life easier. That shows me that you care about her so, so much, but right now the immediate solution that you have in your mind, it seems like it's-it's-",reflection,2
"Okay. Sounds like you got a good plan to follow up on there. All right. Um, now you mentioned that your son is two. When will he turn three?",reflection,2
"-somebody there and, you know, hooking up with somebody.",therapist_input,1
-and into a take care of everyone else thing?,reflection,2
You've got big dreams.,other,3
"I'm-I'm not gonna- I'm not gonna make that call. You'll make that call, but there's a consequence of making that call, and there's big consequences more time probably and Fiona not being around. On the other hand, what I'm picking up is a call to-to do some- do some stuff that may not be racy and exciting and in the big dollars, but me being with Fiona and engaging in this transition into a-a different life.",reflection,2
"Oh, of course, of course. And what are the things that you'd like to be able to do once you get home?",question,0
Good morning. It's really nice that you've come along to see me to talk about stopping smoking.,other,3
"Yep, it is a big ask. So what qualities would you need to have to-to go there?",question,0
"Mm-hmm, and when you and your friends are hanging out, and what- what do you do? Do you go to football games, go to parties?",question,0
"So, what has to happen in order for you to get to tai chi again?",question,0
Yeah. Smart.,reflection,2
"-the thing that helps you just unwind, put an end to the work section and move into your own time.",reflection,2
"Okay. Right. So, um, now that we-we are looking at, um, your second DUI and, um-- Well, so now, Mike, if you don't mind me asking, what would you do differently, um-um, from here on now?",question,0
They were concerned for you?,question,0
"So you feel like your hands are tied, you feel like you're a burden to mom. She's a single parent. She works a lot. You have all of these problems in your life. And it sounds to me like you feel like you're just adding more problems to her.",reflection,2
"Hi, Billy.",other,3
-what would work for you-,question,0
"So you're doing more than that right now. And when you drink more than this amount, it puts you at risk for a number of things, okay? Things like greater risk of injury, damage to different parts of your body, um, just a bunch of different problems. And, uh-- so I'm going to recommend that you cut down- cut down that amount to the recommended limit. Again, that's no more than seven drinks a week and no more than three on a given day. Do you think you could do that? Would that be a good goal for you?",therapist_input,1
"Okay. So being creative with your indoor space is a-is a solution you've come up with yourself for - f there just aren't any good days, nice days outside.",reflection,2
It's gonna be hard to achieve inner harmony-,therapist_input,1
"Mm-hmm- mm-hmm. So that-that-that half marathon was, uh, a very specific concrete thing and you could envision yourself, and you're ready for it and the day of and all that kinda stuff.",reflection,2
"So, you'd like to give up those cigarettes?",reflection,2
"And so, though they're not going to be necessarily like the party scene, they are other activities. Now I'm talking about gay groups and gay activities which are an option that-",therapist_input,1
You were forced to-,reflection,2
"So you're kind of wondering what the point of these visits are, me coming to your house.",reflection,2
Hm.,other,3
What were those six months like for you?,question,0
You're comfortable with that?,question,0
"In my view, it does.",other,3
"Okay. Well, in that I-- in that case, I've got another idea for you. Um, what about, um, maybe when he turns three, you could enroll him in Head Start? Are you familiar with that program?",therapist_input,1
"Okay, so asthma is one.",reflection,2
So you-you'd like to get buffed?,question,0
Mm. So you got this knowledge as a witness there's some family history of diabetes in the past?,reflection,2
"-feel like this is something that you need to do soon because, um, a lot of times, you're just a lot of talk. And then, there's no action. And if you really wanna see results, I think it's something that needs to be done. And, you know, stop being lazy about it and just do it.",therapist_input,1
"Um, have there been some times in the past where you were able to quit smoking completely?",question,0
"Hi, are you Katie?",question,0
For someone else?,question,0
"So-so, uh, have-- last time we talked, you know, you were kind of cutting the-the ex-boyfriend out. This is because he was your dealer, so--",reflection,2
"Okay. So Jean, I really want to congratulate you on taking this very important first step towards addressing this problem that you've had for such a long time, but as the first small step, I wonder whether you'd be open to actually just monitoring your smoking for the next week. And the reason why I say that- because as you were mentioning to me, smoking is so automatic for you that sometimes writing it down helps make every cigarette a conscious act. And I noticed that you were saying to me, you feel a loss of control over these cigarettes. And sometimes just being mindful and writing something down will help you get some control over what you're doing. And that's often the first small step. What are your thoughts about that?",therapist_input,1
"All right. Well, this medication is pretty well tolerated, which means it doesn't have very many side effects. But you might experience some mild muscle aches and pains. If they seem really severe to you, then you should call Dr. Ferris and talk to him about that. Also this medicine can interact with a lot of other medications, and even over the counter things. So check with the doctor or myself before you start anything new. And lastly, grapefruit juice can interact with cholesterol statin 20. So if you use grapefruit juice every day, I probably would switch to a different juice while you're on this medication.",therapist_input,1
"Hmm. But Ricky, let me just check, 'cause I may got this wrong, just check with you that um, there are some friends that you've got who do use who are still concerned about you. Did I get that right from what you said earlier that-that those who are concerned about you and were part of this intervention some of them use.",question,0
"So, what you told me earlier was that you've got into a car with someone you knew had smoked marijuana earlier. What were you thinking?",therapist_input,1
"-it's [unintelligible 00:24:05]. I-I-I know that you, um- you value friendship and-and friendship is very important, uh, and, I'm just wondering how important, um, it would be for, uh, you to remain friends with them and still have your-your sobriety.",question,0
"So what would it take for quitting or changing your smoking to be something that was more important, that raised it up in the list of priorities for you?",question,0
YHmm.,other,3
-and you usually have three to four drinks when you do drink.,therapist_input,1
-to-to the dad that you had?,reflection,2
"Yeah, sort of like a short-term or transition into something else.",reflection,2
"Oh, nice. Okay.",other,3
You were [unintelligible 00:06:04],other,3
Okay. So I hear-- [crosstalk],other,3
"Well, if we're talking about this idea about kind of scaling around the edges of trouble again,-",therapist_input,1
"And yet, on some level, you know, that it's gonna be a lot of hard work for you because of, you know, you've already known how anxious you get about a stash-",reflection,2
Sounds as though that's something you quite enjoyed.,reflection,2
-kids and stuff like that and how you were saying that the offending doesn't fit in with that dream or that idea.,reflection,2
"Okay, great. So, the plan is gonna be that you're gonna quit and, um, the friends that you have that you don't think are supportive, you're just gonna, I guess, not hang out with anymore.",other,3
"Okay, so that's helped you.",reflection,2
You've-you've tried a variety of medications-,reflection,2
-and-and they've done this for other patients so we can certainly make those arrangements if you'd like.,therapist_input,1
"She'd probably help you, but you don't really want to. It sounds like you're a bit embarrassed.",reflection,2
Yeah. Because you definitely need to go to an interview in order to get the job.,reflection,2
"Uh, what one do you remember?",question,0
"Okay. Well, very good. Um, is there anything else that you think would be important for me to know?",question,0
"Um, so one of the things that- that we also have here, we-we have- we can get some case- what they call case management services and that might be someone who comes in and checks with you at home and helps you figure out some of the things that might need to be done like you were talking about, give you a little refresher on safety at home-",therapist_input,1
"Very appealing, isn't it?",reflection,2
Thank you so much for sharing.,other,3
"One of the, um, things that I've learned over the years, Rick, is that a lot of guys get to the doors out there and don't come inside and, um, you've come inside. What does that tell me about you?",therapist_input,1
How could you get in trouble at school?,question,0
"And so, um, the officer at the- at the scene, um, when you blew the 2.8, he-he did-- he-- There was a- there was a problem.",therapist_input,1
What do you mean?,question,0
Yeah. Is there alcohol with the- with-- Goes hand in hand with the bad luck or just--,question,0
"So you've got a lot of stressors right now. You're a single mom raising a two-year-old, you're working full time, and you're going back to school. What do you think would be the most helpful for us to focus on today?",reflection,2
"Yeah, yeah, they really do, and smokers. Yeah, and drinkers, they do, yes. Yeah.",therapist_input,1
"So, what's really getting in the way?",question,0
"Oh, okay- okay.",other,3

"Hi, Mike. I'm Kathy. Appreciate you coming in today.",other,3
And have you had any thoughts yourself about what you think might be causing it?,question,0
- to help you feel safer. And I hope you're going away home today feeling safer.,other,3
Mm-hmm. Yeah. So she wants you to be happy.,reflection,2
"All right. So, you're very motivated to change your drinking and you have a plan to keep from drinking more than two drinks at parties and keep from having unprotected sex. I would like to share how it's working for you. What do you think about coming back in six weeks or so?",reflection,2
Got into the culture?,reflection,2
Okay. Is there anything I missed?,question,0
Don't inject it?,reflection,2
"Because they care about you and-and you respect what they say, and you're wondering whether something about what they're saying may be right, but let's check that out a bit?",question,0
"Okay. So, it sounds like we have two avenues to pursue, anything else?",question,0
That's a good way to think.,other,3
"Okay. Great. Well, I can definitely set you up with that, and you can-",other,3
"That's okay. That's-- Yeah, 'cause it's not important. The important thing is for you to be happy. And, uh--",other,3
What else would get you to a five?,question,0
So what are some specific steps you would need to take to get to school on time for first hour?,question,0
And days that you know of on your less rigorous schedule that you're more likely to succeed [unintelligible 00:07:40] I really like how you're picking like three days a week instead of some days a week.,reflection,2

And I'm glad that this appointment was a positive one for you.,other,3
"-and sort of be looking forward to the future and those things. All right. Well, one thing I'm going to ask you about is, um, you know, different people have sort of different things that they really value in their life. Whether it's, you know, their cultural identity or their family or their friends or job or hobbies, things like that. So here's the little sheet that goes through just some basic values that, um, might be more or less important to certain people.",therapist_input,1
"-um, but it's great to see you, and so maybe a good point to start with is, tell me why you're here.",question,0
You're not a criminal.,reflection,2
"Mm-hmm. So you kind of feel two ways about it. You-you'd like to, um, you feel like at some level that the time is up for that person to go, and on the other hand, there's a certain amount of security in having him in the house and in knowing he's around.",reflection,2
-it was blackout that-- Forgive me for that.,other,3
"Great. So, let's see how well you're doing with these new meds.",other,3
-here to Auckland.,reflection,2
"Oh. So, right now family value is the most important thing to you?",question,0
"Well, there are some products that you could use to take away some of your cravings, and probably the gum would be the best option for you. It's not something you would continue to use continuously throughout the day, however, but gum is something you use just when you have a craving.",therapist_input,1
"So, I don't even know where you can get those. I think—",other,3
And you're wondering a little bit about this time that we're going to spend together.,reflection,2
He did it?,reflection,2
"Okay, what's the mostly?",question,0
All right. All right. Bye.,other,3
"Uh-huh. So smoking has kind of become a big part of your social life now. When you go out, you're smoking, and even during breaks at work, you're smoking.",reflection,2
"Yeah, you know, I'm concerned bout it too and I'd actually recommend that you stop using Methamphetamine altogether. And, um, there-there are a lot of reasons for this but that's-that's would be my recommendation.",therapist_input,1
"Okay, so if you don't have a job you reckon, um, you'll probably gonna keep on offending.",reflection,2
You got the tube down-down from the top?,question,0
And how she feels about you is important to you.,reflection,2
Hmm. What do you reckon to be the-the hardest bit of taking that pathway to-to traveling and realizing the-the dream? What would be the tough things that you'd have to confront?,question,0
"So, what'd it be like if you were more confident in your reading and writing? What'd that be like?",other,3
Okay?,question,0
"Yeah. That would be a really good place to start, mm-hmm.",reflection,2
Uh-huh So how often do you think you drink alcohol?,question,0
Yeah. Does she know that you're here today?,question,0
"Okay. Okay, I'm glad you think so. Um, so, other than this neighbor, or is there anyone else that could help you?",question,0
"So what I've been hearing so far- what again, what a great goal. You've already had some insight of how to do this. So for you, it's really important that you're getting to your first hour because you don't want to go back to sanction days. You don't having- like having all these extra people checking up on you and all those things.You've already have a plan of going to bed by 11:00, turning off the lights, putting your cell phone away. Even the support of your mom is really gonna be helpful for you, um, getting up at 6:15 in the morning with that alarm. I know that seems really early in the morning, but you seem willing to do it. And if you're not able to do it, your mom's gonna help you out as well.",reflection,2
It's helped heaps?,question,0
"Okay, so you meant to reduce.",reflection,2
Right. [unintelligible 00:02:58],other,3

"What would you say if you were talking to yourself, if you like, you know, if you were the coach saying, ""Right--""",question,0
"Yeah, I-I found in the past when working with clients that creating a prescriptive meal plan, um, tends to work for a few days, but then clients usually get really tired of the foods on there. Um, and so instead, I'm really more interested in equipping you to learn how to space your meals and snacks out in a way that makes your body feel energized. Um, and then I can also support you, you know, in looking at the grocery shopping patterns and the meal planning patterns that come alongside all of that.

"Okay, sounds like this is really important to you. You want to make this happen.",reflection,2
"[chuckles] Not necessarily the-the most exciting thing for you to do, but I appreciate you are willing to do that. Can I also ask you to do a little bit of homework between now and next week? I promise it's not too time-consuming. Um, we have a booklet that we like to give folks who are just thinking about changing, who aren't sure that this is something that they're ready to do, and one of the exercises is to write down your top three reasons for change, why you would even consider quitting smoking. And then to reflect on some of the good things as we talked about, as well as some of the less good things about quitting and about continuing to smoke. Is that something you'd be willing to do over the next few days?",therapist_input,1

"Well, I mean, I'm sorry we're a bit late, but you know that's the general practice, isn't it? You know, sometimes these things happen. Um, but it doesn't alter the fact that you do just have a virus, uh, and they are very common. And the nice thing is that it will get better with paracetamol and fluids, and the paracetamol will help the pain. Um, with giving it to the kids, I'm afraid there's nothing we can do about that. It's unlikely they'll get it, but I can't guarantee it.",therapist_input,1

It's pretty exhausting work.,reflection,2
"Yeah. And so, it sounds like there's a bit of a dilemma there, because-- And I guess we should be clear, it's not the occasional drink that's an issue.

So people with Type II diabetes, often, if they get a cut, or a bruise, or something, it takes a long time to heal. Smoking reduces the amount of oxygen in your system, so that can further, you know, limit the time it takes your body to heal.",therapist_input,1

And then also it sounds like you're kinda feeling not so great about your resume and your experience.,reflection,2
And let's talk some more about wine. You keep throwing wine into the conversation. It sounds like it's become a significant part of your daily routine. How much are you drinking?,reflection,2
"Um, so I know that you, you know, you know the consequences of it, and yet you're sharing with me it's just not a priority for you at this time.",question,0
"-so, you're gonna, um, play with me a little bit and, um-",therapist_input,1
"Mm-hmm. It's harder when you're trying to create your career, get that going. You gotta- you gotta be at your- at your top, top pitch.",therapist_input,1
Okay. And what kind of hobbies do you have?,question,0
"Sure. Sure. Okay. Um, and so one thing I'd just like to do is maybe give you some information on, um, maybe obesity or diabetes if you're interested or open to that. If you're, you know--?",question,0
"Well, I appreciate you bringing your weight to the forefront. Do you mind if we explore this issue further?",question,0
You don't want that.,reflection,2
You feel like people aren't willing to help.,reflection,2
I’m getting a strong sense that's what you want as well.,reflection,2
"All right. So where we left last time, you were going away to think about a few things and to, um, develop some sort of plan of action. How'd it go? What were you up to?",question,0
[unintelligible 00:36:53] some of that.,other,3
"Miguel, before we end the call, I did want to go over the answers you gave me on the questionnaire about drug use. Is it okay if we go over that right now?",therapist_input,1
So your pack a day—,other,3
About a five. So you're halfway there. So why did you choose a five rather than a four?,question,0
"Yeah. So, on a scale from 1 to 10, 1 being not confident at all, 10 being very confident. How confident are you that you feel you can manage your anxiety in regards to taking this exam?",question,0
"Uh-huh, so-",other,3
"Okay, and so if- if you were, it sounds like if you were going to do something you'd wanna to do something really quickly like a short- a short certificate.",reflection,2
"If there's too much, then it sort of—",reflection,2
Yeah. Wanting to be part of a group-,reflection,2
-but you're a little fuzzy on the details.,reflection,2
-type places. And the job market is terrible.,therapist_input,1
"Okay. Let me just step back a little bit and ask you a question so that I can better understand where the difficulty that you're having with is. Uh, could you tell me what is good about smoking for you?",question,0
I um--,other,3
Do you wanna wait for that happen? Do you wanna wait for a dramatic experience?,question,0
"All right, Chris, so I need to talk to you because as you know, we have a zero-tolerance policy for drugs and alcohol at this school. And as-as athletic director, it's my job to check in with our student-athletes and make sure everyone's adhering to that rule. And I've been hearing some chatter from some of the other kids about a party this weekend, and from what I hear, where you were there and, you know, I can't confirm or deny anything. So I'm not at the point where I can give you consequences, but I did want to talk to you about whether or not you're drinking and how, you know, you really can't be doing this as a member of one of our teams.",therapist_input,1
Like you are now.,reflection,2
"So, what else have you noticed other than your-your pants are fitting better?",question,0
"Um, where do you see that taking you in the next set of three, four, five years? You know, where do you want to be in three to four years' time? What would be your ideal picture?",question,0
I don't know.,other,3
"Okay. Yeah, no, all those things are good. I mean, I think you know, the will- picking a quit date has been found to be really effective. And, um, uh, I know you had talked earlier and then we'll end in just a couple minutes, but about, you know, like, the willingness or the readiness and most-- a lot of people, a lot of my clients have shared with me that when they woke up that morning, they truly had no idea that was going to be their last cigarette.",therapist_input,1
That strong spirit of you got instilled with her.,reflection,2
"Mm-hmm, okay. Well, tell me, um, on a scale from one to 10, how important is it for you to get a job?",question,0
"Mm-hmm, and when you're hanging out with friends, is there ever alcohol involved?",question,0
Are you having some difficulties with that?,other,3
It's been a while.,other,3
"Yeah, so, um, so but that worked for you, where you just let it go, you thought about your mom, you like what we would call like, you channeled to your mom, you know, and, uh, channeling mom, and then, um, you were able to walk away, and you were proud of yourself and nothing bad happened.",reflection,2
--today.,other,3
"Yeah? I was thinking about the Billy, say, the Billy of six months ago. I'm wondering if the Billy of six months ago would've done that?",question,0
"Okay. Okay, so you're willing to go to bed at 11:00 and then you're going to set your alarm for 6:15 the next morning?",reflection,2
"So I'm hoping that in your appointment next month, we can touch base on this and see how it's going.",reflection,2
"Would that be, um, what would they be like versus getting through this great interview, knowing you're-you're good for the job and all that kind of stuff, and then they boot you out?",therapist_input,1
"-was two? Okay. And, what kinds of things do you like about alcohol?",question,0
"Yeah, you might be lucky then. So-so what do you reckon like in terms of like you're saying you're not sort of sure if that's an issue, and that's probably something that we can be working with, uh, figure it is an issue.",question,0
"Okay. Is there anybody in your life that you can talk to about this, who give you some support for not drinking?",question,0
Great. Thanks for talking with me and I look forward to seeing you again soon.,other,3
And then there's maybe some social aspects to it as well.,reflection,2
"Mm. Okay. Alright. Well, um, I know a little about why you're here today-",other,3
Not many?,question,0
Okay. So it was quite recent.,reflection,2
"That's a huge move up the scale, isn't it? So getting your family on board, getting your whānau on board is going to be really important for us.",reflection,2
"So tell me then, um, Ricky, what- what's the other side of the good things that-that using meth or doing some smoking does for you? Is there a downside to it? Are there problems that you're experiencing?",question,0
Yet you still can seem kind of annoyed that this is something that we still have to do.,reflection,2
"At times. Yeah, so-so what you-- wha-what she might say to us about about- a-a-about your gambling?",question,0
Mm-hmm. Almost—,reflection,2
"Yeah. Chris, I really appreciate you talking with me about this. I know it seems like something that's been on your mind as it is and, you know, like I said I really care about you as a student and an athlete and want what's best for you. So I'm glad we were able to talk about this. It really seems like you have a good plan going forward, you know, really striving for not drinking alcohol at all and if you find yourself in a situation where there's alcohol, making sure to have that limit of one drink maximum. It sounds like something that will work for you.",reflection,2
"Um, and also, if there's any-any-any information that you need from me, please, um, feel free to ask. Um, that the reason that he asked you to come in was because of the blood alcohol level was 2.8.",therapist_input,1
"Hmm. Uh, when you use pot in a group you feel more at home with your peers and more accepted?",reflection,2
"So, you're pretty angry about it. It's pretty outraging that you're forced to change your whole life because of a decision she made six months ago.",reflection,2
"Well, I would want this session though to be for you though, Molly.",therapist_input,1
"Yeah. Uh, the, uh- the idea of, um, having the friends and not drinking, is that something that i-- Would be even, uh, a reality?",question,0
"Well, I think you can still have fun within these amounts. So that's what I'm gonna recommend. Um, I think this is a really good goal, and hopefully, we won't see any more injuries. Okay? So why don't you try that?",therapist_input,1
Am I picking that up?,question,0
"No. No, no, no. Not at all. Um, I just wanted to ask you how it helps you and how you use it. Can you tell me a little more about how you use it?",question,0
Yeah. Yeah. And so you've got Donna around at the moment?,question,0
I really need you to tell me that you're gonna quit smoking. This is really important.,other,3
"-hopefully forever. So, okay, well thanks for-for talking about it-",other,3
"Huh, you feel like you dodged the bullet.",reflection,2
And he's that extra trunk.,reflection,2
"So it really depends on what the activity is, whether or not alcohol is gonna be there?",question,0
"Hi, Liz. Well, thanks for meeting with me today.",other,3
"Excellent. Well, thank you so much for coming in today.",reflection,2
"About 80? Right up there, yeah, yeah? And another question that's, sort of, related to that, how confident are you that you can, you know, you can actually get it sorted and get on with life?",question,0
-kind of minute or so-,question,0
"And as we've been talking, I'm hearing you're saying that maybe if you look back to where you were before you went to the doctor, things weren't quite that right, maybe. Things weren't as good as you thought they were.",reflection,2
So it's pretty effective.,therapist_input,1
"To tell you, it sounds terrible, actually. Yeah. So, that that-that really-- And then- and then, to top it all off, literally, I mean, no sex drive.",reflection,2
So how much time have you been talking about this-,question,0
"-that's your ideas on there which are really important. But again there are some options, that if you wanted to look at, you know, just to at least be able to know what they are.",question,0
Okay. What we talk about is confidential. I only tell your parents about what we say if you give your permission or if I become worried about a danger to-to you or to someone else. Does that make sense?,therapist_input,1
"No. Or- or some of them didn't have an exact date, but m-more importantly, was they-they just didn't know that was the day.",therapist_input,1
Like it's a little treat.,reflection,2
"Wow, that's so great.",other,3
Is there anyone in your life who doesn't use methamphetamine?,question,0
"Okay. So, I'm going to write down then that you've decided to quit.",therapist_input,1
"Okay, well this medicine can really help lower your risk of having a stroke or heart attack so that five years so now when you do retire you can enjoy it without any disability, uh, what are your thoughts about that?",therapist_input,1
So you would have been about 19.,reflection,2
"So, your gut is telling you what? Tell me about that.",question,0
"So, here you are. You're an honors student. You're a star athlete. You've, kind of, been doing everything you've been told for all these years, and maybe last month sometime, you started getting more involved in the party scene.",reflection,2
"Okay. And, what kinds of things do you plan for your life?",other,3
"A bit of a rush. Yeah. 'Cause other people I have worked with say that, yeah, sometimes they get a bit of a rush, that somehow the rush takes over and they don't know when to stop. Not sure if that's what- if that's what it's like for you, but other people have told me that, so.",therapist_input,1
But some.,question,0
"So, your heart says you want this great relationship where there's like a true family unit and you can go on picnics and be together but your mind says, what?",reflection,2
"So, your house is totally smoke-free.",reflection,2
-right now.,reflection,2
"How-- So, messing with you would be like what?",question,0
Yes.,other,3
"Mm-hmm. Okay, so you're kind of skating on the edges of getting in trouble again.",reflection,2
Then you wouldn't have to worry.,reflection,2
"Yeah. And it is hard, and-and I-I think it gets better. My experience was it got a little better. The freshman and sophomore year, you know.",reflection,2
Your housemate may be willing to give you Narcan if they see you overdosing.,reflection,2
"Okay, fantastic. So, on a scale from 0 to 10, 10 being really confident, I can research a gym and go for one walk, and zero being not at all confident, how are you feeling about these two small goals?",question,0
"Yeah, and it's hard to get to stop something you enjoy, isn't it?",reflection,2
"So you're worried a little bit about it and you're going to find out more about it, but you're-you're not gonna take on this notion of being a headache or anything as yet—",reflection,2
My guess is you're probably involved in that.,reflection,2
So that's something you definitely wanna avoid?,reflection,2
Yeah. Throwing up is never fun.,reflection,2
"Yeah, we are having a really good conversation here.",other,3
And-and-and your kids and developing that whānau. Have you had an opportunity to get in touch with her and—,question,0
Okay. What are the things that you like about drinking or like about alcohol?,question,0
"So, for about six months. I'm curious. What do you like about drinking alcohol?",question,0
I-it seems like it-it would be quite a hard pattern to change.,reflection,2
"Okay. Well, one thing you could consider is talking to one of our social workers, they sort of specialize in helping people who have a lot on their plate identifying resources that they may need, uh, things you haven't thought of or aren't aware of. So, I don't know, would you be interested in doing something like that?",question,0
"Okay, I finished the exam. I have some good news and I have some not-so-good news. Looks like you don't have any cavities, so that's the good news.",therapist_input,1
All right. Thank you for coming in.,other,3
"Okay. Well, I'm concerned about the amount that you're drinking currently. It sounds like you're having about 15 to 20 drinks per week, and that's definitely more than what we would recommend and could certainly be contributing to your high blood pressure.",therapist_input,1
"Uh-huh, uh-huh.",other,3
Okay. What do you think is the most you've ever had?,question,0
"Like belonging or sense of community. Again, cultural identity or family, friendship, modesty, religion, respect, self-determination and spirituality. So, when you think about yourself, which of these are kind of most important to you in terms of your life?",therapist_input,1
-what I'm hearing? Yeah.,question,0
"Yeah. So, how confident are you that you could do something similar to these-these friends that you've got?",question,0
"Right. So you can see the links between your weight and your health, and you'd like things to be a bit better.",reflection,2
Mm-hmm. Have you told your mother that you drink with your friends?,question,0
He's got a lot to do.,reflection,2
"Um, many people find that when then- when they are restricting their intake or starting some, uh, ac-activity patterns that are really rigorous, that, um, a piece of their mental health suffers because they start to obsess, um, more than they'd like to be about those things. So, my approach with clients is just a more holistic approach. Looking at certainly some behavior changes that you could make to be more physically active, improve your energy levels.",therapist_input,1
-and reel you in-,reflection,2
"Oh, I understand. Let me ask you this, on a scale from 0 to 10, 0 meaning that there's no way you can do it, and 10 meaning that you're 100% confident that you can do it, how confident are you that you'll be able to reduce the amount of juice you're currently taking in.",therapist_input,1
You trust her back then?,question,0
"-without any alcohol mixed into it. Um, often, having anything in your hand is a good barrier for people who are trying to offer you alcohol, because you already have something in your hand-",therapist_input,1
You want this baby.,reflection,2
Okay. I can email you some information on how to inject in a way that reduces the chance of infection and we also have behavioral health specialists in our clinic who can go over how to reduce harm with you. I bet the syringe exchange has similar resources too.,therapist_input,1
"Okay, so smoking and-and I'm working towards quitting completely sounds like that's a goal for you?",therapist_input,1
"Okay. Yeah, because your-your health really, to me, it's more important than your-your looks. I mean, don't get me wrong, I understand what you're saying, but, you know, it'd be great to get back in those jeans, but—",therapist_input,1
You don't seem too happy about that.,reflection,2
"I know, I-I understand that it was really-- That was your goal. That was a really important thing for you to be able to get home and it sounds like you've been able to really en- enjoy parts of it, and I know you've been going to the- both the physical therapy and the Tai Chi and how's-how's that going?",reflection,2
"Great. And, do you have an idea about what you might want to study or?",question,0
"Mm-hmm. So, there's this external pressure coming from the people you care about to sort of stay in the scene.",reflection,2
Do you feel like you have any reasons to kind of bring your alcohol use down within the limits?,question,0
"Mm-hmm. And those friends that were not hanging around with you, did they come back?",question,0
"Okay. So, what did you say to Donna?",question,0
"Those are some really good ideas and good starting points. So thinking about it like that, what-- Where are you now? What's your-- What-what-- Where-where is your thinking now?",question,0
"So that's something that will motivate you to not do what you did, not commit that crime, and, um, 'cause you do not like when we stop by?",question,0
"Okay. Um, and do you understand then the con-consequences of-of what that would be?",question,0
"Oh, you must be a doctor.",other,3
"Then, can I write you a prescription for the medication? Can we talk about how you could use it? Because this is something that-that's very important. Not just for your overall physical health, for your oral health--",therapist_input,1
"Yeah. That's-- that-- it's-it's really big unknown territory. Pressure High School class is probably 1,000 kids.",reflection,2
"So if you were to-to list all of the different things that people around you are saying that you need to work on or you need to change, what would some of those things be? And, Sal, just because we write them down here, it doesn't mean that you have to change them.",question,0
"Okay. Um, so is that something that you'd like us to help you with?",question,0
You know that.,other,3
It's gonna keep happening that you have to turn down opportunities.,reflection,2
Is that- is that about-,reflection,2
"Mm, so it feels like you always seemed singled out and, um, end up being unlucky.",reflection,2
"Okay, great. Um, do you drink alcohol, including beer or wine?",question,0
"Hmm. Hmm. Yeah, part of the culture.",reflection,2
"Okay. Well, it sounds like you have a goal of not using marijuana once basketball starts. How long do you think you could not use?",therapist_input,1
"Yeah. It kinda messes up that dream, that picture?",question,0
"Uh, tell me-",question,0
All right. Great. Have a good day.,other,3
"Okay. So about eight cigarettes. So over the course of a day, just under half a pack?",reflection,2
"So this morning, that experience, it really brought home how she does watch you, and she does really look up to you and notice what you do. How did that feel when you looked up and saw her watching you?",reflection,2
What brings you in?,question,0
"Yeah, so wha-what would-- What do you think it would do to the relationship of you not drinking but still being with the-these folks-- These friends?",question,0
"Yeah, it is. It's some damage to the roof of your mouth that happens from tobacco smoking and so I'm wondering if you can tell me a little bit how-- about how tobacco fits in your life right now.",question,0
"So, it helps you, kind of, loosen up, feel more relaxed.",reflection,2
His words indicate that he does or he doesn't? You're not sure? I'm not sure about that part either?,question,0
"I guess I also wonder whether, regardless of-of if your asthma symptoms are connected to Oscar, that may be part of you feels like it's worth it because he's been-",reflection,2
"Do you use any tobacco products, or smoke cigarettes?",question,0
"Mm. So it felt like she bossed you around, didn't really listen to you.",reflection,2
"So it's, uh, so when you were talking about like nagging on, tell me a little bit more about, can you give me an example of what you mean?",question,0
"Okay, so for now you know that it makes you feel good.",reflection,2
I'm-I'm sorry. I didn't mean to assume that-,other,3
"Oh, fun.",other,3
"Yeah. So the physical therapy is can- you can kind of still see that it's helping you to build your strength, which-",question,0
"Okay. So what do you think you're gonna need to do to show her and others, uh, to convince them that you are serious?",question,0
"Yeah, I'm the pharmacist on duty. Citalopram, okay. It's an antidepressant and it comes in 10, 20, and 40-milligram strengths. It's excreted in the urine and it has a half-life of about 35 hours. For side effects, there are sexual side effects, heart side effects, and stomach side effects.",therapist_input,1
"There's really no such thing as not drinking too much. I mean, anything that's drinking when you're underage is drinking too much, you know. Like, think about it, think about all the things that can happen to you.",therapist_input,1
"Okay. So, you're concerned about the consequences, and you really care about your baby, and you want to give your baby the best start you can.",reflection,2
".Okay, mm-hmm. Well, I'm wondering then if it's okay with you and-and I have a form that we can use if you'd like, um, just to put out some different ideas on an agenda that we could share as we're working together so that I-I can support you to be successful in getting this behind you. Would-would this feel like a natural time to-to move towards figuring out where we might go together?",question,0
"Okay. Uh, thanks for filling this out. Uh, looks like you use alcohol two to three days a week?",reflection,2
Okay. So you're keeping out of trouble.,reflection,2
"Okay, um, would you mind if I talk to you, if-if I- if I gave you a little bit of information about the muscle weakness, and you tell me what you think?",question,0
"Great. So, you wrote here that you've used alcohol in the last year on at least eight days?",question,0
-maybe got from your parents or something of the sort.,reflection,2
"And again, thanks for your honesty in talking about this. I appreciate that this is a- this is a tough topic. This is a-a hard behavior to think about giving up. Um, I guess one thing that- one thing that doesn't make sense to me is that, you know, on the one hand, you talk about how being a good parent is your highest priority, it's really important to you to set a good example for your daughter-",reflection,2
"Well, you know, I-I understand that pain is hard to work through but a lot of time when you're having rehab after a stroke, that pain is telling you that your muscles and joints are starting to work again. So you can kind of think of it as a positive way to, you know, know that your-your body's getting back to normal.",therapist_input,1
"Well, I want to thank you for coming in today to see me. Um, I do understand from talking with your counselor that you've got quite a bit on your plate, you've got a lot going on. Can you tell me a little bit about that?",therapist_input,1
"Okay. And, how confident are you that you could make a change if you decide you wanted to on that same scale?",question,0
"Okay, so, yeah, just another reason why you probably need to just quit then. Um, okay, yeah. I-- Okay, so, like I said, I'm gonna right down here that you've decided to quit and, um, uh, you know, I'm gonna be meeting with you again probably in the next semester sometime, so we can kinda check-in and-and make sure that, you know, that's still going well-",therapist_input,1
-social circles. Okay.,reflection,2
"Good. Here, take a look, see what you think. And that feeling-",other,3
So let's talk about how we can organize a-a meeting with them.,therapist_input,1
"So you want nicotine replacement, but you don't wanna quit smoking?",reflection,2
-like that?,question,0
"'Cause they can do that. They can- they can kinda give you some, uh, information like, uh, um-- they can give some accurate information, um, and back up your story versus the other person's story.",question,0
Okay. Kind of socializing?,reflection,2
"On a scale of 1 to 10, how confident are you that you'll be able to follow through with that plan with 10 being very confident?",question,0
Any other reasons?,question,0
Here in Christchurch?,question,0
"But, yeah, I-I see what-what you're saying, for sure. Um, there-there's those friends that they drink but they don't drink that much, I heard you saying.",reflection,2
It doesn't matter. So what- what ideas do you have about what might be most helpful for you in quitting smoking?,question,0
"Okay. All right. So-so back together, things are starting to get tense at home, and your relationship a little bit?",reflection,2
Okay. So Donna at the moment who kind of being there is like a strength?,reflection,2
"Well, you can sign right there. Seems like you're not in the mood to talk today.",reflection,2
And how many servings of fruits and vegetables on average per day would you have?,question,0
"So, what is it you'd spend your average day doing now?",question,0
Okay. So maybe visiting a gym and then also choosing a non-gym activity to sort of get started when the weather's permitting.,reflection,2
"No, it is something that there's a couple of different of, uh, you know, a couple of different products out there, but it-it does- it can really help, uh, and-and it kind of gives- might give you this sense of security that you have at your fingertips.",therapist_input,1
"Um, obviously, you shouldn't be drinking at all. Um, what do you think about that?",question,0
Okay. Can you give me an example of a-a recent situation? Maybe we can focus on that.,question,0
Why do you think it makes you so hesitant to call?,question,0
"So all of these things put together feel like right now at this point in life, that it is really healthy change for you, like where you are right now.",reflection,2
"Is this- is this with, uh, with the drug?",question,0
"Okay, and-and what if they won't?",question,0
"Yeah? So, what sort of things has it helped with?",question,0
"Sure. And back to that scale, you mentioned, you said you were a two. What do you think it would take to move you up to a four or five?",question,0
So what's been going on?,question,0
"Mm-hmm. Tell me more about that, what makes you say, ""I have to take that path""? What makes you feel like you need that?",question,0
- what you're gonna take-,other,3
"So, I would strongly recommend that you have the patch. I'll talk to you about how to use that and that we have another product that I leave you to use as when any of those feelings of irritation are coming up, particularly in that first week.",therapist_input,1
That sounds awful. What do you do when that happens?,question,0
"You know what I mean? It's pretty cool, not everybody can do that, so. So you could kind of put yourself ahead, uh, it's almost like watching a movie ahead-",reflection,2
"Mm-hmm. When you're hanging out, is there ever alcohol?",question,0
"So, why are you at a four and not even a lower number? Why are you not like a zero or a one?",question,0
"Okay. So that's an improvement. So you're headed in the right direction. I do wanna let you know that with 18 drinks a week, you're still falling above this low-level risk category, and that it would be my recommendation that at some point you would fall below into this 14 or less a week. But it's an improvement, and it's a great place to start, and I really commend you for your willingness to take a look at this and try to make some improvements.",therapist_input,1
"Uh-huh. So, I mean, do you think it's the thing to do if you wanna be an attorney?",question,0
"Um, you know, you could maybe swap a meal for child care. What do you think of a idea like that?",therapist_input,1
And you showed up today to take care of your migraines.,reflection,2
"It's just tweaking things. Just fine-tuning a few areas and being a bit more aw-aware of one aspect of your life a bit more, like the food choices or whatever. Well, Mike, I-I've really enjoyed listening to your perspective, and your story a little bit, and it's helped me a lot to get an idea about where you're coming from, and a little bit about who you are, and what's happened in your past. And-and we've also talked a bit about what's going to happen next. And you've come up with some great ideas. What I hear you saying is that, you know, before all this, before you met the GP, things are going fine.Well, as you would of-- As, you know, as you'd seen it, you were just doing your thing, and getting on working, and being busy, and being successful, and then suddenly this diagnosis, this doctor tells you that you've got a problem.",reflection,2
"Yeah, clearly, you made a decision because you didn't want to stand out in some way I'm guessing. So, let's-let's talk more about that. Tell me where would you like to take this?",reflection,2
"-the rise in your blood pressure is concerning to me, so I'd like to gather a bit more information about your lifestyle.",therapist_input,1
-check this out? What do you think?,question,0
We definitely can cover that again on our next meeting. Thank you for coming to see me.,reflection,2
"Thank you for coming in today, Katie. I'm looking forward to getting to know you, and maybe just wanna start off with just sharing a little bit about you and what brought you in today?",question,0
Hmm. Hmm.,other,3
"She wants him. So which him does she want, Daryl?",question,0
"Mm. Makes it harder? Yeah. Well, it can make it harder to keep a job, aye?",question,0
So rather than--,other,3
-not smoke?,reflection,2
"Yeah, yeah. So, in terms of their behavior, like how did your behavior sort of match with their behavior? Are they much the same as you, are they different than you?",question,0
"-calling and you hanging out with you, and stuff like that, rather than pretending to be a friend-",reflection,2
"I'm trying to understand you so far, something's concerning you and something's concerning your friends-",reflection,2
-you want to make.,reflection,2
"Okay. So after you've had the quit date, what do you think you might do when it it's the first day at work and it's time to go home if you're not gonna have a cigarette?",question,0
All right. Thanks so much.,other,3
"So-so, what would be really helpful maybe because I might miss it, you know, so, like, could you tell me? It would be really helpful if—",question,0
What's to lose? What's to gain?,question,0
I could see you again in a month. Would that work out for you?,question,0
"Yeah. And I guess I wonder-- Uh, it sounds as though you've-you've dropped doing those things because you felt you couldn't do them, but I wonder if, in a funny way, what's happened is the fact that you're not doing those pleasurable things now, has kind of fed into you feeling-",reflection,2
"Okay, mild schizophrenia is fine. Good. Okay, so-",reflection,2
"And-and what happens when you don't leave it be, what usually happens?",question,0
"So, they're important to you?",question,0
"Yeah, and so it sounds like you've noticed that the more stressed you're feeling, the more you're drinking.",reflection,2
"You're choosing to really damage your mouth and actually, it can cause problems with your teeth too. I don't know if you notice your teeth might be getting yellower than they were before. That's another side effect. There are a lot of really negative things that go along with any tobacco use, whether it's cigarettes, cigars, dip, chew, snuffs, snus, hookah, any of it. This is a really important decision that you're making and you said it's your choice, but you're really choosing to make yourself sick and potentially die.",therapist_input,1
-some of the things that have-,other,3
"Oh, so, the-the-the mailbox, where did that come in? That was the-",question,0
Your freedom?,question,0
So are there other things you do in the evening to relax?,question,0
"What would you really like to happen in terms of, uh, you and your children?",question,0
Mm-hmm. Okay. So I'm wondering how much of what you do on Fridays you tell Donna.,question,0
"Um, we were talking a little bit earlier, and you said you wanted to talk about exercising.",reflection,2
Mm. So smoking pot with your peers to try to fit in more but it doesn't seem to be making you feel more comfortable with your friends.,reflection,2
Every time.,therapist_input,1
"Well, you know that he's not physically available-",reflection,2
"And your parents are a support for you and support you from giving up the drinking, the alcohol use, that's something that they would support-",reflection,2
"You haven't noticed it. So it's a progressive, you know, you've just seen this, as-as you got older, things have slowed down. You know those activities you used to do, but that's kind of like what happens.",reflection,2
"All right, so if you were in a good job-",reflection,2
"Hmm. Yeah, yeah.",other,3
Some guilt?,question,0
"Well, you filled out this survey for us today, which was great. Thank you very much. I just wanted to review a couple of things on here. I noticed that you said that you drink two to three times a week, drink three or four drinks at a time when you do drink, and weekly, um, have more drinks than that. So six or more drinks, it says on here.",reflection,2
-we're looking for here. Yeah.,reflection,2
"And it sounds like you-you've got some solid information already that alcohol, you know, has been safe to-to have during pregnancy. Tell me about that information that you've-you've explored.",reflection,2
Mm. Okay. So- so like before you get to here where you got this dream and there's some things that need to happen before that.,reflection,2
"There's no reason why you shouldn't be able to quit, this is really important.",other,3
Good. Why don't you fill me in on what's been going on since I saw you last?,question,0
"That's why I recommend that all my adolescent patients not drink at all. So if you were thinking today about how ready you feel to stop drinking alcohol on a scale of zero to ten, with zero not being ready at all and ten feeling very ready, what number would you pick?",question,0
That's great and is there anything else on the list you felt like it was coming close to some of the other top five that you had or something similar?,question,0
Maybe this is the-,other,3
"So rather than thinking, ""oh, my God, I have to change all these things. I've gotta stop smoking, I've gotta exercise more, I've gotta, you know, start eating more fruit and vegetables,"" you might start with these small changes, and then-",reflection,2
Yeah? [chuckles] Yeah?,other,3
"Okay, great, so you're doing well. What sorts of goals do you have for after college- oh, after high school?",question,0
"So what I'm hearing is that your life, your work, your routines are-- Sometimes you're driving or you've got to keep awake, get up in the morning sometimes and you haven't quite got that buzz or the energy. You need a shot, and then throughout the day you might need just more shots to keep that energy up.",reflection,2
"And at the same time, it's hard to let go of the past, but on the other hand, you're thinking, ""I don't have a choice. I've got to look this way."" Is that kind of what it feels like?",reflection,2
"Okay. So I guess just going back to why you went to the GP and how you've ended up kind of coming here today. So it sounds like you've been experiencing anxiety for quite a few years. Um, but just recently you moved out of home for the first time and, um, and that was what kind of led you to go to the GP. So how did that change things? How were things after you moved out?",reflection,2
"Well, you sound a bit surprised by that. But I'm sure that you've seen some of the material that-that the clinic gave you about asthma symptoms and managing your asthma, and pets are a really big source of problems in that respect.",therapist_input,1
"Well, maybe that's something that we could talk about next time if you- if you want to.",therapist_input,1
"Just so we know we're on the same page, can you repeat back to me how you are going to take this medicine?",question,0
"Okay. Well, we actually consider 20 cigarettes a day to be a significant amount, and in fact, I would then recommend to you that you would start on the highest dose of nicotine replacement.",therapist_input,1
Mm-hmm. She'd be a good mum?,reflection,2
"Union break. Yeah. le-leverage, and you know so it's something else you might know about nicotine is, um is that actually depending on how you smoke it, it can- it can be stimulant when you want it to be a stimulant if you smoke it in short, shallow puffs and then it can be a depressant like after a meal and you take longer inhalations, and it really tends to act on your central nervous system as a depressant. So it kind of does whatever you want at any given moment and yet there is this price that you pay",therapist_input,1
"Okay, so part of this, what's going on is you also getting bored?",reflection,2
"Some good things I'm- some things I'm good at and there are some other aspects we think, ""Well--""",reflection,2
It'll-it'll take a good usually 10 years off your life minimum.,therapist_input,1
"Okay. So you don't feel very comfortable with somebody telling you what you should be consuming, what kind of alcohol, and how much alcohol you should be consuming. And, um, it sounds like you've been getting some mixed messages, your doctor's saying there's no safe amount of alcohol you can drink, and asked you to come and see me. And then also, you've been checking- sounds like you've been checking things out a little bit.",reflection,2
Yeah. You were made to say you're lucky.,reflection,2
"Yeah, it sounds like you'd be willing to do whatever you can to try to prevent that from happening.",reflection,2
Okay. But you feel that you feel good?,question,0
"So, when you think about what you like and not like about your drinking, where do you wanna go from here? What would you like to change about your drinking?",question,0
"-um, element of it. What seems like a logical next step based on-- You've kind of already gotten the ball rolling. What feels like a logical next step?",question,0
- unhappy with the way that-that your life is at the moment. And-and I guess I wonder whether that can then make your symptoms worse for you.,reflection,2
Just enough for your own use?,question,0
Yeah. You kind of want to avoid that. Yeah. Have those other feelings that could come up and if you don't have.,reflection,2
That's really a big problem.,other,3
"Um, you run a business, and you've got a lot to do.",reflection,2
"Yeah. Yeah, and you also mentioned that you've actually made the appointment that you have to take this exam.",reflection,2
"Okay-okay, so the fact we're even having a conversation about it, it's kind of interesting?",reflection,2
"Okay, great. It looks like, um, the way you filled out the alcohol form puts you into our, uh, third zone of drinking. Can you- can you tell me a little bit about your drinking habits, where you drink, what do you like to drink?",question,0
"Yeah, exactly. Exactly. It's up to you, just a couple of minutes.",other,3
"It's not easy to be in that world and also having that constant reminder that the baby is coming and this baby is saying, ""I want this better life,"" and you want to give the baby a better life too. Who can support you, do you think when-when you look around who's in your circle right now, who do you think can support you in moving towards path B?",question,0
"Mm-hmm, yeah it would, I-I-I think that would, uh, go a long way toward reducing those risks.",therapist_input,1
"Hi, Scott.",other,3
Sure. And it sounds like you're trying not to smoke around him. Why did you make that decision?,reflection,2
"Right-right. So, um, I'll just ask you a couple of questions, um, if you don't mind about-about your drinking. And-and your-- So, um, you said the couple was two weeks ago was the last time you drank?",question,0
Yes. I think so.,other,3
"-and, um, you're, like, real good with, uh, hands-on stuff, but the stuff around the manuals, and the assignments, and those sorts of things, um, don't feel so good. What-what do you think we need to do around helping you with that?",question,0
Five.,reflection,2
"Actually, I'm not going to do that because you're the boss. It's up to you what you want to do with you about your own health.",therapist_input,1
Things are looking pretty good.,reflection,2
"But it might be helpful if you- if you quit or it's, you know, it did if you were gonna decrease or whatever, to see how much better you're doing with the ball going up and your lung capacity increasing, is it?",therapist_input,1
So I understand that you were referred to me by your GP because you've been experiencing some anxiety difficulties.,other,3
"Okay, great. See you next time.",therapist_input,1
"Yeah. Hmm, that might be a start.",therapist_input,1
"So, offending gets in the way of the life that you're starting to lead?",reflection,2
"So what I would recommend then, is to move your smoking outside completely. As a smoker, the ideal situation for a smoker in the house is if their home can be made smoke-free and the smoking is moved entirely outside, especially while he's experiencing this cold.",therapist_input,1
"Right, yeah, but with cigarettes, there is a sharing. You don't see that with any other drugs?",reflection,2
That worries you?,reflection,2
"Okay. And that's a very good reason for being here. Um, can you talk to me about maybe some of your-- the goals that you have?",question,0
"Okay. What about at these parties you're going to, are there other kids there who are drinking a lot?",question,0
"Yeah and I-- Yeah, you really-- You're already like, you're taking a look at this and sure don't need me like-- Obviously, you don't want to be doing that in the first place, but—",reflection,2
"Yeah. Where have you got to with the forms? I mean, we talked about that quite a lot last time.",question,0
-friends outside of band or?,question,0
"Yeah. Well, and then you get the kind of, I don't know if it felt like a green light or a yellow, it went from red to cautionary, you could see your kids, and that was something that was really what you were working for.",reflection,2
"-surrounding that, will that be okay?",question,0
"So, it sure can.",therapist_input,1
And you want them to support you.,reflection,2
Okay. How often?,question,0
"Um, so, when you're sort of looking ahead, how often do you think you might be drinking, say, when you get to college?",question,0
"It sounds like you have-- You've thought about this, and you're-you're willing to put some things in place, the-the wallet, um, money in the wallet and-and for the taxi-",reflection,2
And your girlfriend's important to you-,reflection,2
"Mm. So how much does the kind of, uh, current lifestyle rob you of that, you know, take away from that dream?",question,0
"Hi, Mary, how was your day?",question,0
And they-- I would suspect they'd be less sales pitch-oriented than a private gym. So it might be a safe place to explore first-,therapist_input,1
"Okay. Um, do you feel pretty confident that you could just stop completely?",question,0
"Yeah, a steep, you see before you had a mate who turned his back on offending.",reflection,2
Which you weren't aware of in Palmerston?,question,0
"Yeah, I could see that. Um, may I ask, are you also a single mom?",question,0
Mm-hmm. Finger comes out.,reflection,2
Cool. And do you have a lot of friends who are in band with you or-,question,0
What about it seems overwhelming?,question,0
Anything-anything else?,question,0
"Um, well the good news is that the exam's over and I don't think Jake has pneumonia. What I actually think he has is a cold. So there are some things you could do to manage his symptoms. Would you be interested in knowing?",question,0
"And then, um, you know, people get in fights more often when they've been drinking too. Um, also, you know, there have been a lot of kids, even at this school, who've gotten in trouble because they were drinking and someone took pictures with their cell phone and put it up on Facebook-",therapist_input,1
"It's for your dyslipidemia. Oh, and you should take one every day. Do you have any questions for me?",therapist_input,1
"Well, if we take a look at the low-risk-alcohol drinking guidelines, what it says is for women, um, the safe limits are 10 drinks a week for women and 2 drinks a day. And that's if a woman isn't pregnant. And when it says in the guidelines, as far as drinking, uh, throughout pregnancy, there is no safe amount to drink during pregnancy. So really zero alcohol is, um, the woman should not be drinking any at all. And I'm just wondering what-what are your thoughts on that?",therapist_input,1
How would you define drinking too much?,question,0
"Oh. Oh, okay. So, Um, around that, um, do you ever feel-- You feel bad or-or sick when you're-- Right now, is there something--",question,0
"You've taken time off you, it's costing you time and money being here.",reflection,2
"Yeah. So, uh, how often do you think you'll be needing that plan in the--",question,0
"Okay. All right, so what-what do you need to do, Billy, to actually get to that point where you can fill out a form and post it off?",question,0
"Okay, good. So we can go over your laboratory results at that time, as well as review your plan. Now, would you like some information on smoking cessation?",question,0
"Hmm, yeah. It's really special when you find someone who can be both a friend and girlfriend, eh.",therapist_input,1
-and then also trying to participate in activities without drinking yourself or maybe even drinking less than you're drinking.,reflection,2
"No. So what would convince you to-to make that shift? 'Cause I hear a lot of kind of-- And in this hard, like, y-you've done time and then once you've got a record, the employers- you know, we know, I know that. That's-that's not easy. You can't just wonder into a job, a high-paying job and go, ""Pick me, pick me, pick me."" I know that.",question,0
Does that sound okay?,other,3
I'd be very happy to do that.,therapist_input,1
"Okay, so they-they kinda know how to hook you.",reflection,2
-drinking and your friends are-,other,3
"You did your values clarification handout, and that was part of what I wanted to go over with you today. I wanted to hear about your values and just talk to you a little bit more about that. Do-do you wanna tell me what some of your top five values are?",question,0
Mm-hmm.,other,3
"Hi, Sandra.",other,3
"It-it-it-- Yeah. It may not- it may not when she uses the chronic inhaler, uh, but you'll need to keep an eye on that. Obviously, it would be- what would be best if it didn't get on your clothes, or you quit smoking.",therapist_input,1
Yeah. Tell me more about your weight concerns. When did you start feeling dissatisfied with your body?,question,0
Absolutely.,other,3
"Okay. And so he's a truck driver and you are an aspiring social worker, and you have a son who you want to give a really great life to, and you feel that you and your boyfriend are in different, going in different directions-",reflection,2
"And everyone, most people are using.",other,3
"Okay. So on a scale of 0 to 10, 0 being not ready at all to do that and 10 being very ready, where would you lie on that scale?",question,0
What gym do you belong to?,question,0
Correct. Yeah.,therapist_input,1
-to your meals and snacks.,other,3
"Okay. [laughs] And-and-and, uh, if you wanted to maybe even, you know, a little drinking and weed in there 'cause it's also very kind. [crosstalk]",other,3
"So, it sounds like, um, you can see that you're making some progress in physical therapy-",reflection,2
"Okay. So, what other things have you've been open to at other times in your life when you've been open to-to new ideas and being able to talk about stuff, that may be tough to talk about?",question,0
Yeah. And it really is your choice. You're absolutely right-,therapist_input,1
"I don't know. I think it's up to you where we start, and that's the question I've got in my mind. You've mentioned a couple of things that you've already made some effort, or been conscious of. You've mentioned the diet, you've mentioned your smoking, those are two quite important aspects that we often talk about here in how people work.",reflection,2
"So it's almost like you want your mom to make it say that this is for you. It's not because your mom's making you get up like you want your mom to remind you, ""Hey, remember, this is something that you want for yourself is to be in time for first-hour class"".",reflection,2
So would that be something--,question,0
"There, um, what brings you in today?",question,0
So tell me how you've been managing. 'Cause I don't know if you'd been back dealing? How have you been managing to-to-to—,question,0
"-as well as your teeth. So, we can see some recession that's gonna start to happen-",therapist_input,1
"Yeah, looking ahead, you can't keep drinking this way and reach the goals that you have for yourself.",reflection,2
"Uh, again, if you get to the point sometime down the road where you're willing to quit for both you and her, uh, we'd be glad to help you do that. Because you're right it is- it's not an easy thing to do.",therapist_input,1
Nice to meet you.,other,3
What-what might be some benefits of following through with that goal?,question,0
Where do you keep it?,question,0
"Okay, and why'd you say 8 or 9 rather than even like 5 or 6?",question,0
"So, tell me a little bit about what you don't like about- what you've noticed about it?",question,0
Does he drive long distances-,question,0
You don't feel fulfilled.,reflection,2
"Indeed. Let me ask you something, knowing what you know now, how important is it to you to lose the weight by decreasing the amount of juice that you're currently taking in?",question,0
Do you really?,question,0
"Oh, cute. Have you had him a long time?",question,0
"Um, and tell me on a scale from one to 10, how confident are you that you could get a job?",question,0
"Oh, it's a decision whether it's right or wrong-- It's not gonna be-",reflection,2
"Okay, um, and at some other point we can talk about some other things that you may be able to do including diet, changes in your eating habits, it can lower your cholesterol even more.",therapist_input,1
I'm curious. What do you like about drinking alcohol?,question,0
"Sure. I totally appreciate that, and it's your decision, Olivia. You know yourself best and what fits for you. If you ever feel like you like to open up the idea of conversation about family planning or birth control, I'd love to talk to you about that another time.",therapist_input,1
"But, um, anyway, I think you are hanging in there beautifully, and I love hearing that you're involved in swimming and some other things 'cause they must help connect you up with some pretty-- I would hope-",other,3
When would be a great day for you to start this?,question,0
-maybe you could tell me about how that's going?,question,0
It's really changed your focus. What do you like about drinking?,question,0
Okay. So it has been quite a big step and a big change and it sounds like that that was what led you to go to your GP.,reflection,2
"And the fact that you-you seem to be taking quite a lot of them, and I'm wondering whether it's worth, though, sitting and looking at them and-and maybe trying to rationalize them a little bit, and really decide which are helping you, which are doing nothing, and which may actually be making some of your symptoms worse, I guess.",reflection,2
"-um, then we can pursue those things. So it's really just about what brings you joy in terms of how you move your body and I'm just here to help you figure that out.",therapist_input,1
"Mm-hmm. Yeah, it can sometimes.",therapist_input,1
"So, yeah, again-- Um, so have you something in mind that you might like to use to help you through managing the cravings?",question,0
"You have a few concerns about your health, but that's not really the driving force. It sounds like it's most of all that it would be nice if things just went back to the way they were before she quit smoking and that all of this stuff wasn't something that you had to deal with anymore. Does that pretty much sum up--?",reflection,2
Okay. And that your pet has never been mentioned as a concern?,question,0
"Inner harmony was number two, and having that peace of then to allow yourself to help other people or to serve-service.",reflection,2
"So, Liz, what's something that you'd like to change or maybe that you're feeling two ways about right now?",question,0
Mm-hmm. And there was a war going on?,reflection,2
You felt isolated?,question,0
"I'm trying not to be hard on you, Hailey, but I've got to tell you as a position, it's a very big deal. Your drinking and your tobacco use are red flags for me and they need to stop immediately. So we've already talked about your plan for smoking. You're going home. You're throwing out your cigarettes. You're putting on the patches. What's the plan for the alcohol?",therapist_input,1
All right. So why don't we start by you telling me a little bit about yourself?,question,0
"Oh, three days. You know, that's a long time and I felt, you know, that's a pretty long time to go without smoking and I would imagine, I think that's pretty good.",reflection,2
"Uh-huh. Well, that's, I mean, at least you're not doing that, so that's good, but it's still causing a lot of problems. And as I said, I can see that the evidence in the roof of your mouth, you're causing some serious damage, and this needs to stop. Have you thought about quitting?",question,0
"Okay, that's pretty unlikely with sore throat. I think that's so, you know, a little bit of grand staging there.",therapist_input,1
"Okay, okay, so, uh, sounds like you really want to stop drinking, particularly during the weekdays?",reflection,2
-is a big con.,other,3
Right. It sounds as though you're-you're not happy with that.,reflection,2
"Right, so you've hit a plateau in your weight and despite all the things that you're trying to do to increase your activity, it doesn't seem to be working on the scale?",reflection,2
Okay. How about the other side? Have you noticed any not-so-good things about the smoking?,question,0
Right? You knew that. So-,question,0
"Okay. Well, I think you really need to think about this seriously. Like I said, it's really putting yourself and your child in danger.",other,3
So now it's time-,reflection,2
You seem excited about that.,reflection,2
- and do you have a sense of-of what some of the doctor's concerns were that led her to refer you?,question,0
"No, no, I get that. I get that.",other,3
Okay. That's at least 12 drinks a week.,therapist_input,1
"Oh, it does?",reflection,2
"Sure. We talked about courage before and you've got the guts to be talking with me about this stuff today, and I'm wondering if you actually do have some courage to think about these ideas. I'm not saying that pumping gas at minimum wage is where you wanna go, but-but the guts to actually start steeping into this other world. I wonder if you do have, I'm-I'm-I'm just not sure.",reflection,2
I don't know what pickleball is.,other,3
There's other ways to relax. There's yoga. There's deep breathing. You need to stop raising the roof and raise your kid. This is not okay. You're not just worrying about Hailey anymore. It's Hailey and Jake. You're a mom now.,therapist_input,1
"Hmm. Okay, so she dropped you off here today.",reflection,2
"Oh, okay. So-so, um, you started drinking again, and then she left?",question,0
"Yeah, that's certainly understandable. We both know that there's a lot that plays into weight management, but there's no need to figure it all out today, especially since things are so busy for you right now. Maybe we could put our heads together and think about something small that fits reasonably into your life and then we can take further steps when you're ready.",therapist_input,1
"Okay, and then what about your friends who are still drinking?",question,0
Seems like it's a done deal.,reflection,2
"I'd love to, uh, set up an appointment for you if you can come in later this week or early next week to-",therapist_input,1
That makes a bit of sense.,other,3
"Um, you will be getting violations for that, and then if you get so many violations, I mean, we'd have to write a warrant for your arrest, which is looking more of, um, detention time.",therapist_input,1
"Okay. And it's like here I am one more person, the next- the next doctor who's saying, ""You need to quit smoking, David.""",therapist_input,1
How would that sound?,therapist_input,1
Okay. So-so what sort of things do you think you need to do to go down that path to get that qualification?,question,0
"That's great. And I hope you continue to avoid those things. As your doctor, I want you to know that I'm concerned about your drinking. When teens drink, things can go wrong, like injuring yourself. Even when you don't drink too excess, though, your brain is still developing and is very sensitive to the effects of alcohol.",therapist_input,1
"No, I get it. Yeah. I mean, you know, it sounds like it's, it is helpful to a degree for you when you go out because it makes you feel a little bit more calm to talk to-to guys is that right?",reflection,2
"Okay. I'm also curious, are there any parts about your alcohol use that you don't like?",question,0
"Sandra, can you give me an example of a time that you did something that you think left an impression on your daughter or set a bad example for her?",question,0
Might become a better friend when you quit.,reflection,2
"Okay. I'm wondering about-- because it sounds like this whole idea about filling out the forms, is getting in the way of this bigger dream that you've got which is around getting a qualification around something to do with cars-",reflection,2
Correctly as it's prescribed.,therapist_input,1
"-and then, um, if things are going great, then fantastic, and if you run into any stumbling blocks, then we can maybe problem-solve together.",other,3
"Mm-hmm. Do you feel that there are some parts of your life where you'd like to be more in line with your values, or do you feel like you're really on target with them?",question,0
"Okay. So-so what's the definition, for you, of a good mate?",question,0
So I think it should be really supportive of that then.,reflection,2
"Emily, you said it so well it-",other,3
"Hi, Natalie. I'm Dawn.",therapist_input,1
"Yeah. So catch me up with the conversations you've had with Fiona about this crossroads you're at. You know, these 22 days, you haven't gone back, you've coming out and you're not back? You could pick up this dealing quite easily and probably some workout here tomorrow and get back into it.",question,0
"Excellent, excellent. Thanks, Mike. [croostalk]",other,3
"And anything else, you know, you go ticking down the list. The tire is good, oil good.",reflection,2
So I know just kinda being here when you need to be here is one way of doing that.,therapist_input,1
Okay. So right now you're seeing that it's a part of your life. It's been a part of your life off and on for 18 years.,reflection,2
Mm-hmm. By not putting yourself on the back burner so much?,reflection,2
"Good. Well, you've got some good plans and we'll go check it out and make sure they happen.",reflection,2
"So Tom, this infection is been pretty painful for you but we have antibiotics. If you take it faithfully for 10 days, I'm sure that your infection will be gone. Can you do that?",therapist_input,1
That's great. So should we meet up at the same time next week then?,question,0
Yeah. And what is your favorite cigarette of the day?,question,0
-and to build some confidence in that conversation.,reflection,2
"Okay. Um, he found the most valid information on blogs done by felons.",therapist_input,1
"Hi Mrs. Smith, my name is Terri, I'm one of the nurses who works with Dr. Fields.",other,3
"Okay. Well, we do know that an increase in smoking and alcohol is associated with certain kinds of cancer; colon cancer, cervical cancer, breast cancer, lung cancer, and, um, also pancreatic cancer. It's also associated with liver and lung disease as well as heart disease, diabetes, and hypertension. So that's a lot of information, but I'm-",therapist_input,1
What do you think would happen if you did that?,therapist_input,1
"Okay. So, from now to the next time you come back and see me, what is it that you'd like to-to work on?",therapist_input,1
And now a total stranger will give you a cigarette-,reflection,2
"Yeah. It-it sounds like, um, you know, money could make a big difference, and you are working full time and trying to go to school to address that in the long run. Um, but on the other hand, you know, it sounds like you have some other ideas of cope- of how you might cope with stress better. Um, so, I guess I'm-I'm wondering, given our conversation so far, kind of where you are with everything.",question,0
"So you're right that you're young and healthy and you don't have a lot of complicating illnesses that mean that you would probably do okay if you got the flu. But we do know that the elderly are more at risk, pregnant people, babies are at risk of having serious complications from the flu, and by you getting the vaccine, that helps prevent you from passing it on to other people.",therapist_input,1
Okay. Couple of years. Great. And how do you like Marching Band?,question,0
"All right. Good. Well, I want to thank you again for coming in today, Sarah. It was really nice to have met you.",other,3
Okay. And how often?,question,0
"Cool. What else would, um, would help to kind of keep you out of trouble do you think?",question,0
And harder to—,reflection,2
"And-and yet, we know we can't make perfect safety, but we know that the more you move and the more active that you stay, the less likely it is that you're going to fall and the more safe you're going to be.",therapist_input,1
"""Um, media has said it's okay to drink during alcohol. And so that concern, um, just sort of, I don't have it and, and maybe the doctor might be wrong.""",reflection,2
"Well, I'll perhaps share with you what I know from working with other people and some of the things I've experienced in working with people.",other,3
"Mm, mm.",other,3
What did you cut yourself with?,question,0
"Well, you trying to get a job, maybe and get into some routine.",other,3
Yeah. No.,other,3
"Okay. Cool. And, you know, what made you decide maybe law school or-or journalism?",question,0
Can I help you?,question,0
It sounds-- That sounds good.,other,3
"Very cool. I've always wanted to be good at music. [laughter] All right. So it sounds like you're in band and a-a few other musical ensembles, any other hobbies you have or things you like to do for fun?",question,0
Tell me- tell me what happened when you say they-- like it didn't help you? What-what-what happened?,question,0
"Well, there are a lot of products available now that can actually help you curb that urge to smoke. We have products that can help to replace nicotine, which can help to decrease withdrawal symptoms that you might experience when quitting or cutting down and also some medications that your doctor could prescribe for you that might take away even some of the desire to smoke.",therapist_input,1
"Oh, and-and-- Oh, I see, yeah.",other,3
Was he freaking out? Yeah-yeah.,reflection,2
"And, my sense, is that some of the challenge for you, at the moment? Yeah?",question,0
"Okay, so part of being here with me, and the work we might do, will be to find- try and find- search for that-",therapist_input,1
So it wasn't what you expected?,reflection,2
So you made it in here-,reflection,2
"Hi, Mrs. Smith. It's really nice to see you again. I see you're back to follow up on the stroke you had. How are things going for you at the rehab facility?",question,0
"And it sounds like you have a pretty active social life and a-a lot of friends who you feel probably would be, uh, supportive, even if you cut down on alcohol and that, you know, there's a lot of benefits you see both to your body and your health, um, your school performance, and even some of the social stuff in terms of feeling a sense of belonging without having to deal with some of the gross consequences of-of, um, drinking too much.",reflection,2
Mm. So it sounds you're worried that it's gonna be a waste of your time this time too.,reflection,2
"Okay. So, again, on a scale of 1 to 100, how serious-- how important is it to sort it out? Yeah.",question,0
"Right. So, it doesn't get in the way of your-",reflection,2
"You think it is so much of a fact that you put yourself on the back burner that you were neglecting yourself, or that you were putting others so much before you that you just didn't even think about yourself?",reflection,2
"Well, let's see. One of the things that's involved in managing weight and health is being active. Physical activity benefits the whole body. It's healthy for our joints, our stress levels, and especially for weight management. Perhaps we could talk about some ways of adding activity that fit into your life.",therapist_input,1
-not a normal occasion for you to drink that much?,question,0
"Right person, right company-",reflection,2
"-being part of a gay culture here in Auckland, is feeling good-",reflection,2
"Okay. Uh, anything else?",question,0
"Yeah. So, when you've had to write things or fill out forms before, how-how's that been for you?",question,0
Yeah? You like the social aspect?,reflection,2
"Okay. So, you actually went to the polytech—",reflection,2
Yeah. Okay.,other,3
So you're normally very careful and you use protection when you have sex?,reflection,2
I remember that.,other,3
"Okay. So, that really sounds like something we can do.",reflection,2
-in your mouth.,other,3
Okay. So about how much are you smoking over the course of a day? You had said it had increased over once or twice a day.,question,0
And an activity which has got a starting to finish and it's something you do for a slot.,therapist_input,1
I guess- I guess the way I think about these things is that they're not necessarily either all in the mind or all in the body.,other,3
Do you have any idea why that is?,question,0
"Okay, so if you had a job, you feel pretty confident, but if you don't have a job, your confidence is much-is much lower, is that-",reflection,2
"Good, so, um, we're here today to talk just, uh, about whatever it is you'd like to talk about it.",other,3
"Great. Well, you came in today feeling pretty discouraged about your energy levels and your mood and, um, feeling lousy about your body in general. And, uh, today we've talked about a small-small step to get started and you're hoping to experience some mood boost and some energy as you get rolling here. Um, how are you feeling about today's session?",reflection,2
"Hello, Kaylie, I'm Lori, the pharmacist here at Bulldog Pharmacy. I see that you have a new prescription for cholesterol statin 20 called in by Dr. Ferris today. I wondered if you had a minute to talk to me. I just want to make sure that you know how best to take it, and if you have any questions.",question,0
"So when you look at it, there's probably more to gain from making these changes than there is to lose.",reflection,2
"Okay. Um, so the most you've ever, ever had is two drinks in a day.",reflection,2
"So to end our conversation, how do you think you couldn't move? You originally said, you were at four or five, what would have to happen to get you to like a seven, to feel more confident?",question,0
Really?,question,0
-so it just doesn’t go crazy.,other,3
"A five? So, I'm curious. Why didn't you pick a lower number like a two or three that would mean you're only a little bit ready to stop drinking?",question,0
"Okay. So, this party-time world's- are you feeling like this is something you want to move out of and move into that mom world? Or does it feel like I want to hang out there still too?",question,0
And learning the differences of the different cultures that brings you wisdom.,reflection,2
So you're still kind of unsure if this is something that you could do yet you're saying you really wanna do it because you don't wanna go back for sanctions.,reflection,2
"Mm-hmm. Well, if you think about it on a scale of 1 to 10 where 1 is really don't think you could do it at all and 10 is really confident that you could quit if you tried, where do you think you fall?",question,0
"Yeah. Yeah. Well, we can definitely talk about it when you come in again like-",therapist_input,1
Mm. So you've been working really hard-,reflection,2
It just didn't fit for you to do the online.,reflection,2
"Yeah, yeah. So, you've got, you know, some benefits there then, you know. The social element, hanging with friends and-and going out together is something which is-is quite enjoyable. So, it's not a case of removing it completely but it’s a case of, ""Okay, I’m noticing this is impacting on me more than what I’d like to."" Yeah. Yeah, okay.",reflection,2
"Yeah. And, um, the same with the Nicorette gum, because it- nicotine is an appetite suppressant.",therapist_input,1
"No, I understand- I understand. And I'm certainly not here to tell you what to-to do, Sarah. I'm interested in hearing your thoughts and sharing some information with you, and what you do with that information is totally up to you. You've got a lot going on. You're a mother, you're working, you're going to school, and our healthcare team wants to make sure that you have all the resources available to you to meet your goals, including good health. And my job as your healthcare provider is to listen to you and to share information with you, including healthcare concerns associated with smoking and alcohol. Would that be okay with you?",question,0
"Yeah. Tell me more about that, those previous times that you've been active.",question,0
"No. Okay. So that's- that's not been an issue for you. Uh, it is an issue for him and not for you at this point.",reflection,2
"Well, what made you say five rather than two or three?",question,0
-every time you come in.,other,3
"Sure, sure. You're in the system-",reflection,2
"Okay. So, based on all that information, what are you willing to think about doing to change right now?",question,0
"Nina, I'm wondering, what's your hope for the future? When you think about where you are today, um, what do you hope for when you look ahead?",question,0
"Was it that something happened, um, where you put something that was really important to you at risk? Is that what that was about, um, when you say you felt guilty, uh, you felt bad talking to Erin on the phone?",reflection,2
"Mm-hmm, so, you know, even just hanging out around kids who are drinking a lot actually puts you at a lot more risk. Did you know that?",question,0
22 days you've actually made a decision not to-to pick up your old life and continue on.,reflection,2
There's a smoke update coming up.,therapist_input,1
It sounds- it sounds like you're doing the review of the things that you used to do.,reflection,2
All right. You promise?,other,3
-such a big part of your life for so long.,reflection,2
"Okay, and how come not at like a five or a six?",question,0
"So if you have a stash Nicorette gum if you decide to use it, I mean, you'd have to have other stashes, you know.",therapist_input,1
-isn't a good combination.,therapist_input,1
"Mm. So what's it gonna be like do you think working with me 'cause I'm also a female probation officer? Um, I'm wondering what-what's it gonna be like do you think?",question,0
It's uncomfortable.,reflection,2
"Okay. And, any not-so-good things about alcohol?",question,0
"Stepped in last minute. Um, when you picked up your son, you didn't have any concerns and he seemed happy?",reflection,2
"There's something else I wanna share. When people forget where they are or how many drinks they've had, that's a sign of heavy drinking. And when people keep drinking despite experiencing negative consequences, that can be a sign of what we call alcohol use disorder.",therapist_input,1
"Uh, so you feel like you're doing this all alone?",reflection,2
"Hmm. Some of these things I've mentioned to you, you're-you're not familiar with. Uh, and I think that's because we've done such a good job of eliminating some of these diseases that a lot of people your age, and even my age, are unfamiliar with those things.  Um, so having shared this information with you, what do you think about the idea of vaccines for-for Lilly?",question,0
"Yeah, yeah. Where in particular? You've got any ideas about what—",question,0
And this is a pretty lonely road to-to walk by yourself. I'm wondering who else might be around you that might actually walk with you?,question,0
It's my-- yeah it's my pleasure. It's part of my job and it's probably like this so. I'm going to hurry up and get changed for practice.,therapist_input,1
"Hi. You were saying over the phone, uh, you want to talk about exercise?",question,0
You wanna see it in black and white.,reflection,2
Running around naked.,reflection,2
"Okay. And you know, what's- what's happening for the- for the day, for the week.",reflection,2
Yeah. Yeah.,other,3
"Okay. And I can give you a little card that can help you keep track of it. And if you can bring that back to the next appointment, it could be something we could discuss. Okay. Anything else?",therapist_input,1
-and it sounds like you like the instructor-,reflection,2
"I agree with you, I really do. So-- And I- and I think that a lot of times, um, the medications, they do have a lot of side effects, and I completely understand why people don't wanna take them-",other,3
"Hmm, you get along with her really well.",reflection,2
You like to have a good time?,reflection,2
So what would- what would like a really happy life for Billy look like?,question,0
"Okay, and so what I'm hearing is that you don't feel like your health is concerning you right now, or anything like that?",reflection,2
"Okay, no 12-step higher power idea?",question,0
"And this time, it seems like it's a little bit different this time. How come this time you feel like you might not reschedule this time around?",question,0
"-which you can do. So, it seems a real shame that the forms are gonna get in the way, so we need to find a way around the forms.",other,3
Mm-hmm. Yeah.,other,3
-had some consequences-,reflection,2
[chuckles].,other,3
"Yeah. So, thinking about, like, you know, last time, you-you started to say that, well, you thought it was-- you deserved it and there was some thinking around that, so I'm, sort of, wondering how open you are to-to exploring that from some different angles?",question,0
If you want to do that. It gotta be your call.,therapist_input,1
"Okay, so you know some people?",question,0
"Okay. Well, I really enjoyed having the time to be able to sit down and talk to you about your values. I hope that it's been helpful to you, and in the future, if I can support even any way in helping some of those other values get a little bit more attention, we can talk about that next time.",other,3
"Well, I understand that. I don't have an hour to go to the gym every day either, but one of the great things about physical activity is that any amount in any type of activity can be very helpful. For example, let's think about some activities that you enjoy doing.",therapist_input,1
"Oh my goodness. Okay. And so, and that-- yeah, that's very-- that's really scary beginnings of emphysema, I'm sorry to hear that.",reflection,2
"And so, what have you done in order to start getting them to Hit The Road, Jack?",question,0
"Steve, before we're done with our visit today, I was wondering if you'd be willing to take a few minutes to talk about your drinking.",question,0
"So, would you like to express more on the inner harmony part of how that affects your life?",question,0
"Okay. So you'd, you're feeling a little bit anxious about today.",reflection,2
"Because you've-- it sounds like what you've been doing, you've made some conscious effort to be aware of some of those things you might think are important.",reflection,2
You have to provide for your children.,reflection,2
Okay. Can you tell me a little bit about how alcohol fits into your overall social scene?,question,0
So that's another realization.,reflection,2
"Yeah, yeah. And so that's a very important goal to be able to get back home, to be able to get back to your independence. Have you thought about what it might take to get there?",question,0
"That's very common. I mean, you go where you know, um, no one's gonna look down on you.",reflection,2
"Right. They're still cigars and they're still tobacco and so they still cause lung cancer, oral cancer, emphysema, all those same kinds of things that you would see with cigarette, so it's really important.",therapist_input,1
It does really work.,therapist_input,1
"All right, what do you think's a realistic goal for you then?",question,0
So that one's important.,reflection,2
And it might be hard to be part of that scene and not to be using drugs?,question,0
"Absolutely massive. And, uh-- So, is there a challenge you're up to, to start creating some-some-some of that sort of world for Fiona? 'Cause I'm hearing that—",question,0
Kind of feels like you're climbing Mt. Everest.,reflection,2
So you're sick of this?,reflection,2
That's fantastic.,other,3
"Yeah. And your worry is that if you stop, you will end up gaining weight. So I'm hearing this kind of list of things that don't feel so positive about stopping.",reflection,2
What made you decide to quit smoking when you were pregnant?,question,0
"All right. Uh, well, it sounds like you've been struggling with your weight recently. And I understand how difficult it is to lose the weight and then have it come back again. So, tell me what you did to lose that initial 5 pounds.",reflection,2
And it doesn't quite fit with how you see your own lifestyle.,reflection,2
Yeah. What's the problem? Mm.,reflection,2
"You know, especially if you've been drinking, then, you know, you're at a lot more risk because a guy can take advantage of you. Did- have you thought about that?",question,0
"Okay, you sound really mad about it to-to turn it around.",reflection,2
And what was happening around that time?,question,0
It sounds like she really needs-- she'd like someone to listen to her.,reflection,2
"Yeah. Where's Scott? Where did- where did Scott go? That feisty, spirited guy, where- where'd he go?",reflection,2
"- with your-your female friends once a week, and whether actually doing those sorts of things might generally-",therapist_input,1
"So. Yeah, I- I've heard that-that in recession, uh, those are often the best opportunities for people to start doing business is to, um, see an area where you see a need go in and fill it.",therapist_input,1
"Yeah. And what's been your past experience with smoking? Tell me-- Can you tell me a little bit about kind of how the role it plays in your life, how long you've smoked?",question,0
"What's that about, Billy?",question,0
"It's time to do something, okay. So you've been diagnosed by-",question,0
Mm-hmm. The risks were so scary then that you were able to stop?,reflection,2
"Okay. Do you use any street drugs like any marijuana, cocaine, heroin?",question,0
"I'm sorry about that. It must be very, very frustrating to feel all that pain and not be able to do anything about it. And it seems like the only thing that you can do right now is to cry.",reflection,2
"Oh, I think so, too.",other,3
What-what happened?,question,0
"You want that acceptance, absolutely, yeah, yeah. But won't you say, you know, friends also-- good friends also can, you know, call you on stuff too, can't they? Yeah?",question,0
"Okay. So let's-- Okay, so it sounds like me not being avai-- Was me not being available with you, rela-related to you cutting yourself?",question,0
"So, what steps could you take to help you stop using for a month?",therapist_input,1
They are your experts.,therapist_input,1
Okay. You're more focused on what you need to do to get this behind you?,reflection,2
"So for you being in your class, when that bell rings, then you know, this is the goal.",reflection,2
"Okay. Just so you know, my role, um, when we talk about alcohol use, is just to share information about risk and to help patients who want help. This is different than telling them what I think they should do. I don't do that.",therapist_input,1
So pleasure being your number five.,reflection,2
"Mm-hmm. Okay. So whatever and so far it sounds like getting a job is really important right now and you really need the money and you really need to take care of your children and it sounds like you have some ideas as to how you could get to these interviews for one, and then once you're there at the interview, feeling more confident about your skills, um, getting some child-- reliable child care certainly sounds very important.",reflection,2
"Okay. And then when you do drink alcohol, you typically have five or six drinks.",reflection,2
Mm. Yeah. 'Cause I was thinking about that dream that you've got about the job and a life with Donna and-,other,3
"Okay. The reason why I'm asking this, Rick, is just, um, you know, part of, um, uh, being responsible is turning up and doing the program.",therapist_input,1
"Okay, okay. So, it seems like you're-you're, kind of, in a state in your life of considering your next steps.",reflection,2
A six.,reflection,2
"Yeah? So, what have you been thinking, um, since we last met, about what you might do about getting that kind of job?",question,0
"So, um, since you like meditation so much, it's highly likely that you'd be a great candidate for hypnotherapy.",therapist_input,1
"Right. So, on one hand, you like the feeling of being relaxed and having fun when you're drinking and on the other hand, you don't like forgetting where you are or forgetting how many drinks you've had and you don't like putting yourself at risk for STDs?",reflection,2
"Okay, so you were thinking that maybe exposing Lily naturally to these diseases would be a better choice than using vaccines to help her get stronger?",reflection,2
Okay. Gives you something to do. So we talked like back on that first time we met about how you reckon you've got a short attention span and like things to like to be doing things.,reflection,2
And sort of a-a sense of purpose in a way.,reflection,2
"Okay, and, uh, so talk to me a little bit more about what the doctors told you about-about your risks of stroke or heart attack while you're ta- while you have high cholesterol.",question,0
You are gonna make a start?,reflection,2
"Yeah, okay. So in terms of the things that have brought you here, in terms of the things that have got you into trouble and got you into offending, I'm wondering how interested you are in, um, really getting an understanding of it. So one or zero is like, ""Ugh, not interested at all.""",question,0
"Use the chronic inhaler every day, keep the rescue inhaler around if she needs it. Uh, and let's see how that works.",therapist_input,1
- I guess I'm wondering whether now it would be a good idea to try a different approach to your problems.,other,3
"Mm-hmm. Okay. So let me just show you on this, um, card here, um, from a medical perspective, we know that there's good evidence that shows that women you're age who drink more than, um, three drinks on any one occasion at any- at any sitting or more than seven in a week, are likely to run into health problems from their drinking, either problems they're having right now or maybe in the future.",therapist_input,1
Did you like how your parents raised you?,question,0
"So first, it might be trying to sort out what are the important issues to sort out.",therapist_input,1
"My name's Dr. Betty. I'm one of the new GPs in the practice. First of all, what would you like me to call you?",question,0
"This part of you that says, ""I don't have an option to-to-to make this life better,"" it's wondering, ""Do I have the confidence to be able to make that life a reality?"" What do you think you need to increase your confidence that you can do this?",question,0
"And then their parents find out or the school finds out and, you know, we have a no-tolerance policy here about drugs and alcohol, and really can get you into trouble, and it could put your whole college career in jeopardy. Have you thought about that?",therapist_input,1
Feel like you need to. Yeah.,reflection,2
"Right. So, you're-you're a, um-um, a patient who's been diagnosed with some s- maybe schizophrenia, bipolar.",therapist_input,1
Thanks for coming in.,other,3
"I can try. I can't guarantee because it depends on my schedule, but we can brainstorm about ideas on who can go with you to support you so you feel better about attending.",therapist_input,1
"Okay, so why don't you have a rinse, David. How are you feeling?",question,0
Okay. So you'd like to kind of get motivated with- with the use of an app and that might help you get started.,reflection,2
"Sure. Everyone will age, but that will happen on time.",reflection,2
"-and the other goal being maybe just a walk, um, one time between now and the next time I see you. Um, and I say one time, you can, of course, go more than that, but just with snow in the forecast, it might be reasonable to start with a small goal like that and go for one nice day between now and a few weeks from now when I get to see you again. How do those two goals sound?",reflection,2
"You could. You can talk to the instructor and that way you won't fall, you'll feel confident and you'll start to learn some of the moves. And then gradually over time, as you get a little bit better at doing the moves in a chair, you can start to stand up, use the chair to lean on, and then eventually, you'll be able to get to the point where you can do it on your own.",therapist_input,1
Mm-hmm,other,3
It sounds like you're ready to move up to something that was different.,reflection,2
"So, it's-it's not so much that you don't wanna quit in a way, it's almost, ""How could I do it that would work for me?""",reflection,2
- how are you taking them?,question,0
"-in a way. Um, that takes guts. That takes courage.",reflection,2
£7 a week or a day?,question,0
"If you wanted to bring your wife along, I'd be more than happy to talk with both of you.",other,3
"All right. Well, do you have any specific questions?",question,0
"That's perfect. This medication can be taken any time of the day, but it does work best if taken in the evening, and it's important to take it every day.",therapist_input,1
Tell me what you know about the flu shot?,question,0
"Mm, what's that like for you?",question,0
"Mm-hmm. Okay, so when she's at work, what happens then?",question,0
"Oh, okay, okay. Who's-who's-- What's your girlfriend's name, your best- your best friend, best girl friend?",question,0
"Well, aside from the gum, you could try the nicotine lozenge, that would be another option for you. Again, that's not something you'd wanna use continuously throughout the day. The nicotine patch is the best for continuous nicotine replacement, but again, that's not something you can use while you're continuing to smoke.",therapist_input,1
"'Cause you can't find a leper colony anymore. So, um, so it-it's really important for you to be a good mum-",reflection,2
"Okay. So, does that mean you're gonna stop drinking?",reflection,2
"Okay. Well, when you think about your drinking and, sort of, looking forward in 5 years or 10 years, how do you think that drinking might fit in with your life?",question,0
"Okay, you're kinda getting pressure from other people who are drinking, and it feels easier for you to-",reflection,2
"Yeah. You felt like she was the only person that, um, you had in your life, you needed your friends and--",reflection,2
It's really getting in the way of you becoming who you wanna be.,reflection,2
So what do you reckon would happen if she knew?,question,0
And what did he have to say?,question,0
"Yeah, thanks for that, okay. So, let's think about the-- It has to do with how you just sorted out the thing around the gambling 'cause last time you were here, you told me that you get a buzz, you know, it seemed like you were gambling a bit more than your girlfriends were aware of, and-and you said you owe one of your friends some money.",reflection,2
There are some medications and some different approaches that we can use that aren't so abrupt. Recognizing that it-it's going to take some time and practice to get to where you might want to be.,therapist_input,1
"Good. And see if you can fix it up, and also give some thought to what we've talked about.",reflection,2
"Okay. Head Start is a very affordable, very high-quality preschool program. Um, it was really created for parents and families, just like yours, folks who have a lower income and fewer resources, but Head Start really prepares your child both socially and intellectually for going to school. Um, and you know, by the time he turns three, you may find that that routine is something that's better for him to get used to before he starts kindergarten. Uh, would you like some more information on local Head Start sites?",therapist_input,1
It's a long time.,reflection,2
"And so, it's easier for you to just not do it.",reflection,2
I'm sure it's pretty overwhelming.,reflection,2
"Just was feeling like, ""Ugh, it's gonna be a waste of my time coming here.""",reflection,2
"So what would you like to do next, you think?",question,0
"Oh, oh, you're talking about your friends.",other,3
Okay. Would you like to talk more about that?,question,0
"Yeah, so if you had something on your resume that was around education training, maybe a certificate of some kind of a field that you're interested in, that you would feel proud of yourself.",reflection,2
"It's very helpful and healthy. So, yeah, a couple of really good ideas already you've got, guess so?",question,0
I really appreciate you talking to me about this today.,therapist_input,1
"So, uh, if-if you're walking out now, I can walk out with you and just take you around our counseling center. I can even introduce you to one of the counselors.",therapist_input,1
"I, uh, mean that's up to you.",reflection,2
"And you just mentioned too, you feel really proud of yourself.",other,3
"Okay. Well, as I said, there's a lot of irritation, in particular, like I was mentioning, up here in the roof of your mouth, it's turned really definitely white-colored and there's little red spots. And you probably didn't notice because we don't spend a lot of time looking at the roof of our mouth, but you're really damaging this tissue in your mouth, which can really cause some severe problems in terms of your oral health. It's called nicotinic stomatitis. And this is something we don't see in any patients who don't use tobacco. So, maybe you're not smoking cigarettes, are you smoking a pipe or cigars? Or is there something else that could be contributing to this? Because I don't know what else might be causing it.",question,0
"Okay. Interesting. So, do you know all the bad stuff about alcohol?",question,0
Okay. Try to cut back a bit and see how that goes.,reflection,2
I'm really glad you did too. I really appreciate it because that's the only way that we can work together-,therapist_input,1
Okay. Okay. So—,other,3
"Oh, dear.",other,3
"You didn't hurt anything, right?",reflection,2
-and it's not one that you're gonna make in a hurry.,reflection,2
You knew that.,question,0
Mmh. So how come you thought it was going to be a waste of your time? What was it based on?,question,0
"Okay. Well, smoking really is really bad for you, you know. It causes things like lung cancer, emphysema, heart disease-",therapist_input,1
"Okay, do you smoke at all?",question,0
"Mm-hmm, that's some really significant steps you're talking about. You're talking about putting the alcohol away, that's huge. That's-that's really big steps.",reflection,2
"I'm-- okay, but you know--",other,3
-really a rough night.,reflection,2
"Is there anything about marijuana that worries you, many things that you don't like?",question,0
Yeah it is. It is.,other,3
"So if you experienced a negative consequence from your drinking, uh, that would feel meaningful to you?",reflection,2
"Okay. Great. Sounds like you have, like I said, really good goals and you're working hard in school. Um, you said that when you're going out with your friends, you like to hang out and shop and stuff like that and also go to parties, so do you drink alcohol?",question,0
"Okay. Um, but we were talking a little bit earlier-- earlier in our conversation, you had said that you did feel like it was maybe causing some of your agitation. So it's a little bit of, I'm not sure of what-- Um, so where are we? Did-did you-- do you feel like you do have some agitation out of coffee, or is it just no problem at all?",reflection,2
"You can't, no, not one of mine. So, um when are you thinking you might want to do this?",question,0
"That's great. It's important to know this about yourself, what works, and what doesn't work, and what you feel motivated to do. So, it sounds like we sort of have two small goals right now. One is to maybe visit the YMCA and-and find out how much that costs-",reflection,2
"Um, but you do have a choice about how you are here when we meet, and what-what we talk about here. So, um, you know, so you do have lots of choices within that. And, my sense is you're, sort of, you know, a young woman who will make some good choices about that 'cause you're not a bad person, and you know that.",reflection,2
"Sounds good. And if you need to relax, go for a walk, join a moms group, read a book. How about you come back in a week when we have Jake's six months checkup and you can let me know how that quit plan is going.",therapist_input,1
"Yeah? So, it sounds like it's a really-- something's really important to you about that.",reflection,2
And you think you're-you're able to cut down to those levels of no more than seven a week?,question,0
Okay. How about in the last year?,question,0
"You mentioned at the beginning of our conversation that you have a history of dealing with anxiety, have you ever talked to a counselor about that?",question,0
"Good. One of the other things we're really conscious of with is, um, sometimes we do this work in isolation from others. And one of the things we want to ask people is about who they're going to be accountable to. I'm thinking like with your children, uh, your mom and other people that maybe you're interacting with. Who-who else in your life do you think would be supportive of you, and who would you need to let them know that you're actually going through this sort of program?",therapist_input,1
"Yeah, yeah, okay, okay. So Sarah might see it as an issue. And-and I guess there's a part of you also sees it as an issue, part of you, you know. Part of you may not, but a part of you does.",reflection,2
"Uh-huh. What is it that makes it a five instead of a one, no confidence?",question,0
Okay. To make a change-,reflection,2
"So, again, I hear your overall goal is really, to not give up these things you'd like but to cut back on how much you have-",reflection,2
You don't. And who's sitting on the porch with you?,question,0
So what does she think about you coming here?,question,0
"Okay, okay.",other,3
"Mm-hmm, you didn't go to college for that.",reflection,2
It's a hindsight again.,reflection,2
"You've told me what is good about smoking for you. Uh, can you tell me what is not so good about smoking for you?",question,0
It's harder to think straight when you've been drinking?,question,0
"So now that we've discussed a little bit of your medical history and- and taking your vitals, I'd like to ask you a few more questions. The-",therapist_input,1
"Mm-hmm, so what-what would need to happen or how would you know, when you- when or if you ever did have to make a decision about whether to keep Oscar with you or not?",question,0
"So, one thing that could make a big difference is if you could figure out some sort of more reliable, affordable childcare, and that would help you not want to drink as much.",reflection,2
-it sounds like you'd like to try and give it another chance?,reflection,2
"If you were to pick one of those, which one do you enjoy the most, um, would be most likely to do?",question,0
"So, one of the things that we started to touch on, last time, was this issue of gambling, and, um, you were talking, last time, about how the gambling had, sort of, got you into trouble with your family.",reflection,2
You've been stuck?,reflection,2
"Okay, so, what I'm hearing you say is that, it sounds like a feasible short-term plan, not ideal and not comfortable because what you really enjoy is that cigarette with a glass of wine, kicking back up on the sofa and chilling out perhaps while you're watching TV. And to maintain that long-term outside smoking outside in Canadian winters where it's cold and snowy, not realistic.",reflection,2
"-it and stuff, but, you know, being at the pub, you know, you want to sort of get the buzz of, you know, gambling, you know, horror situation, really easy to just go against what you decide that you wanted to do. Yeah?",therapist_input,1
"I'm gonna make sure I understand. You have tried drinking a couple of times, and you almost got in trouble once. Did I get that right?",reflection,2
"-and getting on this road where you're staying out of trouble because you've got this, um, interest-",reflection,2
-would like to make some adjustments-,reflection,2
"It's a big deal. You can't drink either. You're 16. The drinking age is 21. I think you know that. You could get into an auto crash. Uh, I just wanted you to hear this. I don't' tolerate it as a doctor drinking or driving with somebody who's under the influence, and if you do it again, I'm gonna tell your parents.",therapist_input,1
Apples for breakfast.,therapist_input,1
"Okay, so you don't even know.",question,0
-and it's-it's hard-,reflection,2
That'd be great.,other,3
"However, I'm pretty concerned about something I'm noticing in your mouth. Actually, if you look up here, the roof of your mouth, I'm noticing a lot of irritation that's really consistent with tobacco use. And you had said on your form that you're not a tobacco user, so I'm just wondering what's going on.",therapist_input,1
So everything else looked pretty good?,reflection,2
"So when you think about these things, are there any things you would like to change about your marijuana use?",question,0
"Okay. And then, um, you know, like, are your friends in band drinking?",question,0
"All right. So here, it looks like you wrote that you drank alcohol on a few occasions in the last year, and you have used marijuana more often, 30 days in last year.",therapist_input,1
"Yeah, what would she say about-- 'cause she knows you pretty well. She'll-she'll-- she goes to the pubs with you probably and see you putting the money on pokies, what would she reckon?",question,0
"Yeah. And you've been going to school. I mean, all-all your movement is in this really positive, highly motivated way. And, um- and I think your-your thoughts and ideas about the fact that one day a conversation will- you'll strike up with somebody and it will happen to be with somebody who works for a company that perhaps does not have a policy against hiring people with felony convictions.",therapist_input,1
"Okay, great. And, how about friendship?",question,0
"Yeah. Okay. And, um, that night, what was it that you-you drank and, how much?",question,0
Do you have children in your house?,question,0
"Well, Good luck with basketball practice. If you want anything or need to talk about something before our next appointment, I'm here Monday through Thursday, and it's always good to see you.",other,3
"No, no. That'll be easy. So what is the first step for you?",question,0
Mm-hmm. Okay. And do you feel that that's working pretty well for you or do you sometimes exceed that limit or-or what do you think?,question,0
It's-it's not permanent.,other,3
"Great. So on a scale from zero to 10, zero being not at all ready to make a change in the area of physical activity, and 10 being let's- let's do this. I'm excited. I'm ready. Um, where- where do you fall on that scale?",question,0
Yeah. All right.,other,3
"Is that what I'm hearing? Yeah. So in terms of dealing with it, where-where would you be, do you reckon? How interested would you be in dealing with that stuff?",question,0
It's for the cancer society.,therapist_input,1
"No one likes to be controlled, uh, yeah. Yeah. Uh, and, in what ways, well, did you feel that, um, uh, at any time, did you feel controlled by your friends. You said they-they made you drink those shots. That-that sounded like maybe you felt a little controlled? But-- [crosstalk]",question,0
"Well, as I think you know, Methamphetamine use is associated with some health risks. And the amount that you're using it-it puts you in a category that we consider a risky user. And that contrasts with someone who it says addicted, um, someone who's a heavy user but it's not in a healthy category because people who use Methamphetamine tend to run to a number of consequences. And actually one of them is, um, sexually transmitted diseases. Do you suppose that your STD might be associated with your Methamphetamine use?",therapist_input,1
"Yeah. Yeah, I can really see that you're making an effort. In fact, I can see that you're really making an effort in lots of areas, not just in terms of reading and writing.",other,3
And you're feeling kind of concerned about that.,reflection,2
"Okay. So, they gave you a horde of forms for a particular course?",other,3
Okay. How long ago did you start playing saxophone?,question,0
Is it like every weekend?,question,0
"All right, thanks. Call me anytime.",other,3
"Indeed, yeah.",other,3
-on that same scale from one to ten?,question,0
"So what I'm hearing you're kind of saying is, that there's-- You're now starting to think of some very useful little starting points.",reflection,2
We- we're gonna work with you to help you stay home as long as you possibly can and be safe.,other,3
"Oh, all right.",other,3
"Okay. Well, Hailey, what they suggest is that women don't have more than one to two standard drinks a day or a total of nine standard drinks in a week. How does that fit for you?",therapist_input,1
So it sounds like you have two goals right now. You want to tell your housemate about where you keep the Narcan in case you overdose and you want some information on how to inject safely?,reflection,2
And what does a few drinks look like? Is that per night? Is it two drinks?,question,0
The other three?,question,0
Bye-bye.,other,3
Minimum wage-,reflection,2
And you want them to know?,question,0
-for a while to-to let go of. What do you- what do you think of that?,question,0
Truly.,reflection,2
"Sounds like you attribute your current situation to bad luck. If that's what you believe and you don't attempt to make any change in your behavior, what consequences might result?",question,0
"And then, you know, it might be, I definitely think that if you're committed and it's summer break, it's something you could easily get done in a week.",therapist_input,1
"Here's the part where I share information. The safest level of drinking for teenagers is zero drinks. That's because we know a number of negative things are more likely to happen when adolescents drink. We know alcohol can harm how the brain develops as an adolescent and teens who drink are more likely to hurt themselves by accident. Sexual assault is another thing more likely to happen and so are sexually transmitted diseases. I'm curious, do you think your drinking has anything to do what the possibility of having an STD?",therapist_input,1
"So, thank you for coming in today.",other,3
"Yeah. And, get-getting to the polytech and getting the forms, that's a pretty big deal.",reflection,2
"Yeah, maybe that, I'm wondering the conve- the conversation with him that might be around actually how did he do it, and how did he stay without slipping back across the line, 'cause like-like get this crossroads you've got the path and go the other path and go here, so I'm wondering about conversation with him, what would it take to have that conversation?",question,0
"All right. Well, I appreciate you coming in. We'll set up another appointment and, um, get our resources together. We'll take it from there and—",reflection,2
"So, and I would- I would-- it really is because it wasn't like that 20 years ago.",reflection,2
"Well, you know, what, I-- There are a lot of people that wouldn't disagree with you on that exactly. You know, so, um, uh, but I know that they-they were never quite sure how they were all interacting all together. Like the, um- the weed kind of tends to make people a little paranoid anyway.",therapist_input,1
"Okay, so I wrote a prescription for an antibiotic for Aiden and that should help with the ear infection, but in looking through the chart, I mean, it seems like he's had six or seven of these just in the past year or so.",other,3
"Well, you just take it once a day. Did he tell you what side effects to expect?",question,0
"You're drinking more coffee. So what I've heard you say so far is, if I can just start right back from the beginning and you used to come in and sais, ""I went to the doctor."" You went for-- it sounds like you went for just a checkup.",reflection,2
Okay. And he encouraged you to do that.,reflection,2
"Um, I guess 80 is quite high, what makes you say an 80 over say 50?",question,0
"And I know that, uh, Dr. Fields talked with you last time about maybe trying a tai chi class to see how that would go, and I wanted to-to check in with you and see how tai chi went.",question,0
"Mm-hmm. So, do you think you can quit?",therapist_input,1
"-it's hard. But is-is there, I just wonder, is there a connection at all between the-the-the-the acting and the meth use in terms of the effect of the meth use on your- on your ability to get work?",question,0
Too much.,reflection,2
"Okay. But you owe her some money and you get the sense that-- Or I'm picking up, you get a sense that she's not terribly happy.",reflection,2
"-that nobody has the right to tell you what to do. Um, can I ask? If you were to-- Uh, if there was to be a situation where you decided, ""I must quit,"" what-what would that situation be?",question,0
You were pretty shocked at what you learned about your patterns.,reflection,2
"Yeah, right.",other,3
I didn't even know they had a spice channel. [chuckles],other,3
Okay. So you said 30 to 40%. What would it take to build that confidence to about 45%?,question,0
"So, how long do you think you could go without drinking?",question,0
"Okay, and so that's maybe like 20 times a year.",question,0
"Okay. Great. So, um, in addition to exploring the gym possibility, what sounds like a logical next step for a non-gym activity to get started, some small goal that feels doable, um, and you have control over because it doesn't require the perfect weather-",question,0
"And, yeah, it might be an issue, I don't know if it's an issue at this point. It'll be interesting to sort of talk about that. But I'm wondering what happens, yeah, when-when you get on the pokies out there, they're certainly at the pub, pokies around? So what happens in your body when, um—",question,0
"So, what needs to happen next?",question,0
"-but I wonder what are your experiences with Oscar, you know, when he's in the house or-or maybe sleeping near you or you're around him, what happens with your asthma symptoms?",question,0
Would you like to-,question,0
Hi. Are you Julie Thompson?,question,0
"Well, I could give you my opinion. Um, and I can give you lots of information, but I think you know the score pretty well. And I think you'd know what I would say.",therapist_input,1
"Um, so you've talked a bit about like the emphysema. Um, what did the doctors say to you when you were diagnosed? I mean the obvious, right?",question,0
"Yeah, yeah, yeah. Then, in terms of the pokies and stuff they much as they like doing the pokies so much as your doing the-- You know, compared to you doing the pokies?",question,0
"So, you realize, again, that if you decrease the amount of juice you're taking in, you're gonna decrease your weight, you're gonna feel better, and you're gonna impact your po- health positively?",reflection,2
"Okay. So that's where you wanna get to. Um, what do you think that you need to do in the next, like, month or so to maybe help going in that direction?",question,0
And make sure that you actually quit drinking.,other,3
"So you're just starting to question a little bit about whether or not it might be what is useful and, you know, it-it does really come down to what works for you and what-wh-what you decide will help you stay safe. And I'd like to work with you as I know Dr. Fields would, to-to help build a plan that will help you feel as safe as you can in your home-",reflection,2
Would-would it work out and--,question,0
Okay. What do you think it might be like for you to explore that with them?,question,0
"Um, I did wanna talk to you though. I'm a little bit concerned looking through his chart of how many ear infections he's had recently. And I-I noticed that you had checked the box that someone's smoking in the home. So I was wondering if you can tell me a little more about that.",therapist_input,1
Yeah. How about frequency? Do you feel like you're good on how much coffee you're drinking?,question,0
But that would be steady and pays well?,reflection,2
"How confident are you to do these two things? On a scale of 1 to 10, 1 meaning not ready at all and 10 meaning very ready, what number would you pick?",question,0
Do you think you could go two months without drinking?,question,0
It's great,other,3
Okay. And what's- what sorts of treatments have you tried for-for this before?,question,0
So the idea of having to test-test your blood sugar and take medications is kinda like off--,reflection,2
"Okay. All right. So, it sounds like you-you've actually worked this out until be out within a couple of days.",reflection,2
"All right. Well, if it's okay, just for a moment, let's put the- let's put the changing the eating pattern off to the side, and let's take a look at some other time in your life that there was something you really wanted to accomplish and you did. And what is it about you- what was it about you? What kind of strengths did you bring to the table that allowed you to tackle something that felt like a challenge and-and allowed you to be successful?",question,0
"Sounds like you're noticing quite a few not so good things about alcohol though your mom got mad at you, you're having decreased focus, you're, kind of, not doing so well in school, maybe-",reflection,2
"Have you given any thought to, if you'll be able to afford to pay someone on a regular basis to watch your son?",question,0
"Just your own whānau here. [unintelligible 00:01:51]. Well, Rick, I'm sort of, uh, interested in that, you know, you and I are gonna been doing some work together for a while. I'm sort of wondering what sort of thoughts you'd be having on your way here today.",therapist_input,1
"Your bar money would be somewhere else, not in your wallet?",question,0
"So, where are the forms now?",question,0
That's a great goal to have for yourself.,reflection,2
So he fits the picture-,reflection,2
Marijuana is really useful in your life in helping you relax?,reflection,2
"And you had this fall or semi-fall, and you're feeling like maybe- maybe you were pushing too hard?",reflection,2
So you're gonna quit then?,question,0
"Okay, so for you getting on time for first hour is something you'd like to work on the next 30 days?",question,0
"Okay, so if I would write down here, um, what do you think- what would you want me to write? Tomorrow or the next day?",question,0
"Um, I'm wondering what you remember about what-what Dr. Fields said about the Tai Chi in relationship to falls. Did she talk with you about that?",question,0
So you feel that your differences in career choices is-is having an impact on your relationship with your son?,reflection,2
"What would you think about trying that slightly different approach for say-say two or three months, just to see whether or not it makes any difference?",therapist_input,1
"Sal, you're almost on the strongest one. And if Oscar is that important to you, then do you put Oscar higher than your baby, than your wife? Like, uh, that makes no sense to me. Do you understand how important this is?",therapist_input,1
Is it-- Why'd she leave?,question,0
Mm-hmm. Yeah?,other,3
Yeah. And you're still with her?,question,0
"So, it sounds like, you know, the childcare issue has been getting in the way, and so finding something that would work for you would be really helpful.",reflection,2
"Yeah, because you'll get that inflammation down.",therapist_input,1
Or one shot or-,therapist_input,1
"You've indicated that your alcohol consumption is a bit higher than that, putting you at risk. So that's why I asked if you'd be willing to talk to Dr. Kirtley.",therapist_input,1
Okay and would you like to come back and see me again?,question,0
"So, you've decided you wanna cut back on your smoking a little bit, but, you're not really concerned about your drinking.",reflection,2
So something's changed recently?,question,0
"Hi, Dr. Martin. I'm Lori. I'm the pharmacist on duty here today. I understand that you have some questions about the medication citalopram. Do you have a minute to talk about that?",question,0
"No. No, no. I just wanted to show you where it is and let- make sure you know about our resources here at the college.",therapist_input,1
"So, that would be can- the Cancer Society. So, we can look into that.",therapist_input,1
Your friends would be pretty comfortable with that?,question,0
"Um, and also maybe get to the point where things are different in your life Where you're not getting into trouble and things feel a bit more sorted in your life.",therapist_input,1
"Now, have you done this sheet more than once?",question,0
"So having shared that information with you, how do you feel about the idea of the flu vaccine?",question,0
"Great. Well, let me see if I've got this all. You came to Arizona six months ago, you're trying to figure out new rhythms and patterns for yourself. You're looking back at the past few years, and in college, you were real active because you were an athlete, and now it's more up to you about making that choice of physical activity, and you're discovering that, um, not being active has affected your energy level and your mood, and that's something you're looking for more of, both of those things, energy and-and a mood booster.",reflection,2
Yeah? You just described to me how it looked like a minute ago.,reflection,2
All the chattering.,reflection,2
"Okay. Um, so one of the things that, you know, is really important to talk to teenagers about is drinking and driving. So, um, you know, that's actually a really big problem. And even around here, we have kids die every year from getting in a drunk driving accident. So that's something that you really need to make sure you're not doing, all right? Have you ever done that? Have you ever gotten in the car-",question,0
"You know that, um, positive peer influences have been helpful for you.",reflection,2
"Well, it's-it's high, uh, you know, they--",therapist_input,1
Yeah. So they're really important to you?,reflection,2
So you can see some advantages to reducing the amount of drinking-,reflection,2
"-again, and-and-",therapist_input,1
"All right, great. And then, i-it sounds like some of the benefits you're expecting are, um, health benefits-",reflection,2

Excellent. I'll see you in two weeks.,therapist_input,1
"Okay, so you feel like it would be embarrassing to ask Donna to give you some help-",reflection,2
"And-and so-so-so there's opportunities- there's opportunities in one world, and I'm wondering about what might make it hard to see opportunities in a different world?",question,0
"Mm, kind of feel like you're pulled between two worlds there.",reflection,2
"Oh, so, someone who'll stand up for you?",reflection,2
"It sounds like you're in the right track, looks like you care about your health, and you care about your goals in life. I'm here to answer any questions.",reflection,2
-the big trouble. Yeah.,reflection,2
"You know that I will be stopping by every day just to make sure that you're here and following and-and responding to your GPS and making sure that that's charged up every day and that, um, if you're leaving the house without permission, that we will be aware of that as well. Um, and kinda just to get to know you as well when I come for these visits 'cause, um, you know that's kind of my role as your caseworker is just to-to monitor your day-to-day stuff.",therapist_input,1
"And so she would kinda look after what you ate and healthy things that you had, spread in front of you and off you go.",reflection,2
"So, what does staying home look like for you? Is that something that-- You know, you-you talked about drinking at an event. Would staying home be--",question,0
"Okay, so you don't wanna be back here. You don't wanna be sitting here and-",reflection,2
"Yeah, good.",other,3
That really helps you get through things is to be able to laugh about it.,reflection,2
"Hi, Andrea, thanks for coming in.",other,3
Sure. So what I'm picking up is-is that-that-that's a life that you know a lot about.,reflection,2
"Hello, Kaylie. It looks like you're here to pick up a prescription today.",reflection,2
Okay. So what other kinds of difficulties that you have been experiencing?,question,0
-are the other three?,question,0
"So you feel like, um, what the doctor's saying and this brochure just kind of feels like, yeah, it's just kind of blowing things up out of proportion a little bit.",reflection,2
Yeah. Yeah,other,3
Okay. Can you expand on that a little bit more? What do you mean?,question,0
"-and, uh--"" So, really, what we'd like to talk about today is-is get a sense of, um-- Let's talk about the things that would be good to work with, um, over the next, you know, nine months together, really.",therapist_input,1
"Um, and then there's some negatives with, um, you know, your-your co-workers, um, that they don't, you know-- then your boss may not want you, you know, checking out-",reflection,2
That's really a lot. Very good.,reflection,2
Mm-hmm. So it help—,reflection,2

"-as to why you’re-you're drinking. In terms of looking at cutting back on-on drinking, you know, on a scale of 0 to 100 and 100, uh, meaning it’s tremendously important for you and 0 not important at all. How important is it for you to cut back on the drinking?",question,0
