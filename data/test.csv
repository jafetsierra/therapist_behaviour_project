Definitely most important.,reflection,2
Because there are clubs and there are groups and there are all kinds of things that meet through the week.,therapist_input,1
What else?,question,0
Okay. Okay. And what about tests? Have you had any tests for these problems?,question,0
"-for quite some time, and they're really important to you.",reflection,2
"So, uh, any thoughts on what you may be able to do to-to help at this point, if you don't choose to quit right away?",question,0
"Modified and looked at, to get the best out of ourselves, to get the best out of the opportunities we have.",therapist_input,1
Tell me more about that. What do you notice specifically about your mood on the days you're physically active?,question,0
"Cool. So how interested would you be to find out more information about how he did it? 'Cause I'm thinking about this is someone who you know, you've done time with, got a relationship.",question,0
Mh-hmm.,other,3
Right. Okay.,other,3
"You mentioned earlier on, the doctors talking about you monitoring your blood sugar.",reflection,2
"Yeah. So I'm wondering what the-the thinking, 'cause, um, one of the things that's really changed for you is being with Donna.",other,3
"Okay. So, it's-- It sounds like you're actually pretty comfortable with setting a goal of not drinking anymore a-at least at the next part? and seeing how it goes.",reflection,2
"Sure, we can do that together.",other,3
Okay. Wh-What makes you say that it's gotten worse?,question,0
What's going on with that?,question,0
Okay. All right? You're welcome.,other,3
"Well, you have a choice about what you open up to me about. Absolutely, you have a choice about that, yeah. That coming, being on sentence, no, you don't have a choice about that, um, well, you have a choice, 'cause, I mean, you can choose not to come, and you'll be breached and get to head back to court.",therapist_input,1
Sure. So life on the outside is pretty different than the kind of-,reflection,2
So how long ago was that?,question,0
What would help you do that?,question,0
'Cause you could've come in here and said-,other,3
And how often do you think that happens?,question,0
"And it sounds like your mom has been an option in the past, but perhaps not so much anymore.",reflection,2
"Okay. We'll continue with the exam, but you know where I stand on this. Okay?",therapist_input,1
And you don't have equipment.,reflection,2
"Okay, excellent. Well, it sounds to me like the increase in your drinking could certainly be contributing to your high blood pressure. I think decreasing the number of drinks that you have when you go out and maybe decreasing the number of times that you go to the bar each week could be the best thing that you can do for your health.",therapist_input,1
Yeah? It is really hard.,therapist_input,1
"It's the same thing. It's Wellbutrin, and when they found out by accident through what we call serendipity that you know what, Viagra. [laughs] That when- when people were on Wellbutrin that they tended to decrease and stop smoking, and, um, there were a couple of different reasons for that. Number one, people tend to get depressed when they quit smoking, because it puts you in such a state of deprivation and, um also-- well, so Wellbutrin really is a good antidepressant for them.",therapist_input,1
"Yeah. And, what are you concerned will happen if-if you get hurt or if something-",question,0
"A respirologist diagnosed that, and-and how are you feeling right now?",question,0
I think so. So you've identified one of the four that might-- you might be willing to-to try-,reflection,2
"Yeah, that's certainly true. I'd also like to ask about some health habits that can contribute to high blood pressure.",other,3
I've never heard of Union break. I love it how you said. I love it.,other,3
"Um, and the other idea you talked about before was, actually, cutting up your credit cards. So kind of amazing what that thing makes there on different cards isn't it?",question,0
-those relationships just didn't come together?,question,0
"I think anything you do, it has to be something you've decided. You know, just start where you want to start. You've mentioned some really good ideas about possibly getting a little bit more exercise into your life, doing something like squash or something of that nature. You've mentioned some really good ideas about reducing the amount of sugar you-you-you're-you're intaking during the day, and coffee is a good place to start. Having an apple for breakfast, I think you mentioned that, a bit of fruit.",reflection,2
I know how you feel. Managing weight can be frustrating. Maybe we can just start trying to figure it out together and I'll be here to help you through the challenges.,reflection,2
What you want to do in life? Can you explain?,question,0
That would be a concern for them as well as for you now.,reflection,2
"And it seems like if you really want to see the results you have to put the time in. And if it's gonna take you two hours, then it's gonna take you two hours. And, again, if you want the results that you want, you need to start, and you need to start now.",therapist_input,1
Yeah. Yeah. So you've got some good reasons to try to cut back a little bit.,reflection,2
"So, where you said you'd like to start, Sal, is talking about your asthma and specifically about your dog and how one is affecting the other.",reflection,2
"- and I think perhaps you need to have a bit of time to think about it and then perhaps come back. Perhaps if you're booked in for a double slot next week, and that would give us a good chunk of time to think about this new approach.",therapist_input,1
I think that would be a good- a good start.,other,3
Does that sound like something you'd like to do?,question,0
"Okay. I see you've had a bit of experience with, uh, coming to prevention services.",therapist_input,1
"Okay. Well, that sounds good. So, why don't we meet again in a couple of weeks and you kind of update me on how cutting back on your drinking has gone, and also, what it was like when you met with a social worker? Sound good?",question,0
Okay. So we're talking about spending £50 a week-,reflection,2
What are you not sure about?,question,0
Hi. You are [unintelligible 00:00:02]?,question,0
I wonder what it'd be like if you ran your own background check and got the report to see what's in there.,therapist_input,1
You feel alone.,reflection,2
"Uh-huh. So, you thought it was beautiful and you liked the instructor, but you were a little self-conscious because you were in a chair?",reflection,2
So something to look into if you're interested.,reflection,2
"Mm-hmm, yup that's one step, just sign the papers when I come by. Even though it seems like it's kinda annoying at times, it is something that we're contracted to do.",therapist_input,1
"Based on your reason for your visit today, I feel like you really wanted to play soccer, and you have great goals about that.",reflection,2
Mm-hmm. Is there anything in particular that's happening right now where this is more of a concern for you than usual?,other,3
What's important to you about your family?,question,0
-changing who you are fundamentally.,reflection,2
"Mm. Because even though it's important to you, maybe they don't know it's important to you.",reflection,2
"And if you're not alive, that's gonna solve the issue for her. She'll do better.",reflection,2
"So, shall I see you again next week?",question,0
"Well, dancing is a great exercise, especially because it's fun.",therapist_input,1
"So on how-- It depends on how-how that goes. Let's say, if you started doing that and you do some more exercise, you start to have longer blacks, rather than short blacks with lots of sugar. And you get down the sugar and you find your blood sugar starts to come down, then we're heading in the right direction.",reflection,2
"Yeah. So, yeah. And it's, uh-- So, um-- so you-you know that when you're kind of channeling your mom, that helps. It sounds like you taught yourself almost. Like there's-",reflection,2
"In marking it down, okay.",reflection,2
"So, let me summarize a little bit what you've told me. It sounds like you have a pretty hectic, stressful life, and you really feel like you need some kind of-",reflection,2
-and model for your- for your daughter who's at this age where 15 would be a really common age at which she might decide to smoke.,reflection,2
"Oh really. You know, and I've heard that too, Carrie, that people especially you know those are, um, some people seem to have a lot of success but when people do have the adverse side effects they are really pronounced like the ones you just described.",therapist_input,1
"Oh, yeah? Yeah?",other,3
"So, if you got a DUI, you would really know.",reflection,2
"Okay, so a phone is a distraction for you. So keeping your phone away-",reflection,2
"Um, we started off talking about how your drinking has sort of drifted into a risky area, and it would be advisable to cut back. Um, but it sounds like you feel like that's fairly important to you and not something you necessarily want to do. But on the other hand, we've talked about ways in which that perhaps could be made a bit easier, but I'm not sure if you're ready to tackle that or pursue that right now. I'm just kind of wondering where you are.",question,0
Right. Yeah. Because you're- you're the kind of parent that wants to make sure your kids are doing well.,reflection,2
So the last thing you'd want is for your daughter to start smoking.,reflection,2
"Uh, okay, well",other,3
"I understand that your asthma symptoms have been just really out of control. So, we need to look at some of the ways that you can get healthy and not be back here again.",therapist_input,1
You're feeling regretful.,reflection,2
"So there's that on the one hand, but on the other hand, there's the kind of immediate, um, feeling when you've had a few to drink and you're with your mates and it feels like it would be a bit of a laugh?",reflection,2
Comes as a big surprise. And what was your reaction when he told you that at the time?,question,0
"Okay. So, you'd be with Donna, and you'd have a house, and you settle down, maybe have some kids?",reflection,2
"Hi Carrie, thanks for coming in today.",other,3
"And, I- I'm sorry about the wait in the waiting room.",other,3
It sounds as though your list is like definitely a story. I-It kind of attracts you in the beginning as far as your health and the number two was being service. Number three. Uh—,reflection,2
"Okay. Well, it sounds like you're really here just for information today. I'm happy to help you pick out some of these products if and when you decide that the time is right for you.",therapist_input,1
Okay. And how often do you think you drink?,question,0
"-um, we-we're-- You're here probably because of your speeding ticket. That's what I gathered.",therapist_input,1
"Mm-hmm. So, by the end of this week, so by next time, when you come here, as in, those forms will be at the polytech?",question,0
I wanted to pickle and stuff.,other,3
"Yeah, okay. And then the other thing I should mention, Jill, um, drinking more than these quantities, it's-it's possible it could be pushing your blood pressure up a bit, and I'm wondering if that might be affecting the difficulty we're having getting your blood pressure down right now.",therapist_input,1
"Okay. Um, you don't sound very much like you think that's gonna work.",reflection,2
"Snort it, smoke it?",question,0
"You could've done that, but you're not. So I'm wondering what's different? 'Cause you may have done that in the past, I don't know, Daryl, with other people like me, but-but sounds like something's different this time.",reflection,2
The gym.,reflection,2
"While this baby's growing in you and you think of all the opportunities that could come out of this, there's a part of you that says, ""I'm still that same girl that was drinking and partying,"" and-and maybe not living the life you wanted to live.",reflection,2
"And, do you think that, um, this is most weekends or occasionally? How-",question,0
That's great. It sounds like you've got some options and leads on how- on how to get that done.,reflection,2
- I'm wondering if she knows that.,therapist_input,1
- quite troublesome to you.,reflection,2
"Right. Oh, that's good.",other,3
You probably think that I'm going to get on your case about that or something.,reflection,2
"Well, to get it sorted. Not necessarily to stop. But we don't- we don't know whether-whether stopping's the right answer here, I don't know, but-but, your confidence to sort it out.",therapist_input,1
"-right, and get you upset. And then bad things happen and then you get in trouble.",reflection,2
I couldn't believe that.,therapist_input,1
"Okay. Um, so I mean, do you think they're really good friends of yours if they're gonna give you such a hard time?",question,0
"So, you know it's normal.",reflection,2
"Oh, you are welcome. Thanks for being so open with me. I appreciate it.",reflection,2
"'Cause it is decadent, it's lovely.",therapist_input,1
"So if-if the gym is what brings you the most joy, then we can work with that, but if you, um, start to think about it and discover there other activities that you're more excited to attend and you're more, um, you're looking at rear-rearranging your schedule too because you really want to be there-",therapist_input,1
"Yes, tell me a bit more about that, Billy? Kind of give me the [unintelligible 00:05:46] the cops have got it on for you?",question,0
"Yeah, yeah, yeah? So that's 12 times. So how many times would you have walked away with money in your pocket after, any out of the 12, what's your- what's your sense?",question,0
Yeah,other,3
"Okay. You know, that is your choice. I mean, I-I-I can't make those choices for you, it is something that you decide to do. Um, so with that being said then, these will be the consequences. I'll have to read the-the violation for you.",therapist_input,1
[inaudible 00:05:55],other,3
"Okay. Have you noticed putting on any weight, or anything like--?",question,0
"Hey, Mary. I wanted to bring up to you, um, that your battery died last night. So, can you tell me what happened?",question,0
Is that right? so that's on your mind right now?,question,0
"-to quit drinking. Um, I'm just wondering, have you, um, would you be open maybe to just kind of taking a look at what Canada's guidelines say about drinking? Um, is that something you'd be open to?",therapist_input,1
"Basically, my job is to meet with all of the students. I meet with everybody about once or twice a semester and just talk with you a little bit about how things are going, different behaviors that you might be engaging in, and thinking about any changes you might wanna make for your life if you decide that you do. It's not my job to change you. I couldn't even if I wanted to. That's not my role at all. It's really to help you think about, you know, how things are going for you and how you might like making changes or moving forward.",therapist_input,1
How do you think drinking alcohol affected using a condom this time?,question,0
-raised down there?,question,0
"So, you mentioned, you pretty much will like hold a drink or maybe have a drink or two. What do you thinks is the most alcohol you've ever had in-in one day?",question,0
And do you agree that that's what you need to do in order to be able to get home?,question,0
Right. And so it-it-it's been a bit of a rush for you coming in.,reflection,2
"Um, have there been any times when you've started the interview with that conversation so that you don't even have to go through the whole thing and then get rejected?",therapist_input,1
"Okay. Um, so I guess we'll talk about, um, less alcohol activities. I'm just making some notes to myself and then maybe, um, reducing the amount of drinking that you're doing if alcohol is involved. Okay. Um, so that-that goal sounds feasible, you said? Would it be okay if we met in a couple of weeks to sort of see how it's going?",therapist_input,1
Yeah-,other,3
"-what they want to further their dreams, yeah?",question,0
"Hmm. So, it doesn't make total sense to you that-that it's all Oscar's fault and that-",reflection,2
This is not what you've envisioned.,reflection,2
Okay. And what have you come up with at this point? Do you have sort of a-a limit that you stick to or are you--?,question,0
Has there been times in the past where you’ve tried to cut back on drinking?,question,0
Trouble's not fun.,reflection,2
-you're not putting yourself-,question,0
"Hi, are you Julie Thompson?",other,3
"Okay. So, four or five. How combat, like, not like a two or three.",question,0
"And so you're really kind of reeling right now from, uh, all of that. And you sound a little bit pretty, pretty scared actually.",reflection,2
How about this question? What might happen within a month that might make you want to vape?,question,0
"Yeah. Um, so tell me, what would it take to get you to like a five in confidence, to feel a little bit more confident about getting work?",question,0
"But now you seem to be thinking looking and thinking, ""Maybe things weren't, or aren't, as good as I thought they were.""",reflection,2
"Mm-hmm. Well, technically, we define binge drinking as having more than four drinks on one occasion.",therapist_input,1
And then sent you out in your car.,reflection,2
"So I get a sense it's a little anxious being here today and, uh, meeting someone like me, and, um, what we're gonna be doing today is-is inducting, but also I wanna talk about, um, yeah, the issues that-that have got you here and we need to do some sorting out around, um, yeah how serious you are to sort of sort those issues. So?",reflection,2
-and you're gonna—,therapist_input,1
"Okay. So, you can give it a go and, I think doing managing, you might just learn a little bit about how easy or difficult it's going to be, and-and also what it's like to cope with stress in other ways.",reflection,2
"My perspective as a doctor, it would be good if you could think about cutting back a little bit or doing something different about your drinking. What-what do you think about that?",therapist_input,1
"Yeah? So you're the sort of guy, Daryl, with guts?",reflection,2
"Great. So you've come up with some reasons to stop drinking, like having hangovers and throwing up and getting into trouble. And you've developed some strategies to-to try to not drink, like spending more time with friends who don't drink or having non-alcoholic drinks when people around you are drinking alcohol. I think that's a great plan. I'm really proud of you for giving this a try. How about if I have you make an appointment for two months from now and then I'll see you back and we can see how things are going?",reflection,2
Yeah. It should feel like there's something really wrong with you.,other,3
Would you be open to kind of exploring the idea of birth control and family planning?,question,0
Okay. Tell me a little bit about your family.,question,0
Yeah. And do you have your kids with you full-time or-,question,0
Not being a baby. This is a pretty normal- this is-,therapist_input,1
"Well, maybe, we c-- we can check that out to see whether-whether it's a lot or-- But maybe also importantly to-to discuss with you what the effects are and-and-and what your concerns are about it. But help me to understand a little bit more of what it's like for you. Tell me- tell me what are the things about your, uh, use of meth that you- that you've liked that you found good for you?",question,0
"In summary, the Minnesota State, Mankato security report states that you were stopped on Stadium Road last Friday, cited for driving under the influence, and then you were transported to detox. Plus, you're only 21 years old. Is the report accurate?",therapist_input,1
I want to be more physically active than I've been.,reflection,2
"Okay. So you feel like, right now, smoking's a pretty important part of your life. It's not something you're ready to change, but if the time came when you did decide to quit, you feel pretty confident that you could go ahead and do that.",reflection,2
"Yeah. Why, what happens if you take a little too much of it?",question,0
Yeah?,other,3
-as an alternative.,question,0
Yeah.,other,3
"Yeah? Yeah. ""Do I continue with the, you know, my little current lifestyle,"" and you are so much the party girl you used to be-- I was speaking to last time-",reflection,2
"Yeah, it's hard, isn't it? It's hard being in the pub thing, in that environment.",question,0
But they don't feel as scary to you now?,reflection,2
"Yeah. Well, the good news is he doesn't have pneumonia. It's just an upper re-respiratory tract infection and a cold. So there's some things you can do to make- to help him get better. You can avoid excessive dust. You can keep him hydrated, avoid over-the-counter cold remedies. Keep him away from people who have flu or cold-like symptoms and avoid smoke. And the last one should be easy because you quit smoking during your pregnancy.",therapist_input,1
"Yeah, and-and, coming in, talking to a stranger, you know, and someone who can be honest to what you did, talking to a stranger, coming in this time, what do you sense about how you're doing so far?",reflection,2
Mm-hmm. [chuckles],other,3
It's really up to you. Probably a little bit sooner would be good.,therapist_input,1
"Oh, so you're drinking a lot?",question,0
"Tommy, I'm just so concerned, you know, can't you think of anything better to do?",question,0
"-and, it's moderately important to you. It's something you would like to do because you have these big goals for yourself, and you actually feel very confident that you could be successful with it. What sort of goal do you think might be good to set for today?",question,0
Mm-hmm. So you two get to spend Friday together and the weekend.,reflection,2
"Okay, yeah. Well, it’s great that you’re able to identify, you know, what’s going on at the moment and you've-- not only know that, you almost picked up on a bit of a pattern too you're in-",other,3
"Well, it sounds like you care about Sarah a great deal. You-you don't want her, uh, using steroids. You're worried about what kind of effects those would have on her and you're- you're working hard to keep your smoking away from her so it doesn't affect her asthma.",reflection,2
And I completely agree [laughs]about wanting to avoid the sales pitch-,reflection,2
"Okay. So, you drink with friends, sort of three or four beers or mixed drinks, one or two times a month. How long have you been doing that?",question,0
"All right. Well, thank you Mike. I appreciate this.",other,3
You still run and have a cigarette?,reflection,2
[chuckles],other,3
It shows you your lung capacity.,therapist_input,1
You've gone down that road of kind of going back to school in some ways and getting a tryout or-,reflection,2
"No, wait a minute. That has everything to do with what we're talking about. I can't believe at the end of this appointment, you're just slipping in the fact that you've resumed smoking again. That's very, very important information for me to know. And I'd like to spend some time talking about it now.",therapist_input,1
"Dylan, you told me what brought you here today, what do you think the problem really is?",question,0
-but because Dr. Fields has recommended it and your friend has-,reflection,2
"Okay. So, you sort of have a plan to cut back on-",reflection,2
"So, um, it would perhaps be helpful if you could narrow it down to just one thing, and what would that be?",question,0
"And then-- Yeah, and then also you said if you're going to have people, uh, you're gonna be drinking for the Super Bowl. Was is it Super Bowl?",question,0
Yeah. Yeah. Exactly. All right. Any other questions or anything else I can help with?,question,0
"Yeah, yeah. It's a little bit here, a little bit there, so it then adds up, yeah? Yeah.",reflection,2
"So Monday morning after the party will be a good day, and that's next week. Okay. Now, one of the things that we do in the pharmacy is recommend that you use medication to help you. You know this increases your chance of success and it makes it more likely that can manage any cravings that come along. A lot of people like using nicotine replacement therapy which comes in a variety of formats like patches, gum, you've probably seen people using any of these products. And other options are tablets which you can get from the GP.",therapist_input,1
"Yeah. Okay, so sounds like so-some budget to buy stuff will be helpful.",therapist_input,1
So a limit of four a night doesn't feel right to you?,reflection,2
"So, in-in what ways has, uh, drinking, um, sort of, uh-- What is kind of the good things about drinking since those couple of- those couple of years, and then-then maybe not so good things?",question,0
Um.,other,3
Okay. Okay. And that feels about right to you?,reflection,2
They could tell what—,question,0
"And it's kind of dawning on you there may be some possibilities here for making some changes. Let me ask you this. Um, let's say you put some of these things in place and you start to make some of these small changes.",reflection,2

£50 a week.,reflection,2
"Even more mess, you see.",other,3

"I-it a-almost, um, feels like you identified as being a runner, like an athlete?",reflection,2
How could you get a different social life?,question,0
"Yeah, yeah. What would happen if you-- if you looked at, maybe reducing that with that habit? Would that get rid of maybe some of the things that are problematic?",therapist_input,1
Because you don't know the timeline?,question,0
"Yeah. Well, I'm so glad that you reached out for help, um, and just know that you're not alone. And-and so, yeah, is that okay if I share a little bit about, um, how I tend to work with clients on that topic?",question,0
You're nervous that you've lost control of your behaviors.,reflection,2

Um--,other,3
Playing basketball and playing video games are a way to feel better.,reflection,2

Your mom is really important to you.,reflection,2
"Okay, so I think that's a pretty common misconception, because they're fruit-flavored, people think they're okay. Those are really bad for you. Did you know that?",question,0

"Kia ora, Ricky, welcome back.",other,3

What are your favorite parts about it?,question,0
"Okay. Um, would it be okay if I do share you what will happen if you don't charge your battery.",question,0
"Mm-hmm. So there's your oral health, there's the financial aspect, and then e-earlier you brought up some concerns about smoking cigarettes and how that can be harmful for you.",reflection,2
Where do you- where do you feel you fall into that?,question,0
Mm.,other,3
"All right. Well, you're going to take one tablet of cholesterol statin 20 one time a day by mouth, and you can take that with or without food. When do you usually take your medications?",therapist_input,1

Thanks for filling it out. We give this form to everyone once a year regardless of why they come in. It helps us provide better care. Is it okay if I take a look at what you put down?,question,0
"Um, and then, then you'll be better set for college too because, you know, the issue is you're getting good grades now, but when you get to college, it's a lot harder and, you know, if you're needing really good grades to get into law school, which you will need, then you really can't be distracted by alcohol.",other,3
"Fantastic. Well, um, now we can start looking at if you're interested in how that might look-",therapist_input,1
"Well, thanks for-for talking and playing with our little things here.",other,3
"Well, there's all kinds of things you can use now. It's not as hard as it used to be. You can use nicotine replacement. There's patches, there's lozenges, there's gum, there's the inhaler, there's nasal spray. We can talk about medications. You can try Chantix, you can try Zyban, there's quit smoking groups you can go to, there's hotlines you can call.",therapist_input,1
"Hi, Laura. So, thanks for coming in. I'm not sure how much you know about why you're here or what we're supposed to talk about. So, basically, I'm going to be meeting with all the students in the school usually once or twice per semester. And we're going to talk about, you know, whatever's kind of going on in your life. I'll ask you some questions about, you know, your goals and what you like to do for fun and those sorts of things. And then we'll talk a little bit about, you know, different behaviors and-and stuff like that. And so, it's-it's pretty casual, pretty informal, just sort of a chance for me to get to know you if that's all right.",question,0
